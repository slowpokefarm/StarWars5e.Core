&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his bestiary is for storytellers and worldbuilders. If<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you have ever thought about running a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game using my SW5e conversion for your friends, either a single night's adventure or a long-running campaign, this book contains page after page of inspiration. It's your one-stop shop for creatures both malevolent and benign.

Some of the creatures that inhabit the worlds of *Star Wars* have origins rooted in real-world mythology and fantasy literature. Other creatures are *Star Wars* originals. The monsters in this book have been culled from all multitude. Herein you'll discover classic critters such as the rancor and the dewback next to more recent creations such as the shyrack and the porg. Common beasts mingle with the weird, the terrifying, and the ridiculous. In collecting monsters from the *Star Wars* mythos, I've endeavored to reflect the multifaceted nature of the game. *Star Wars* monsters come in all shapes and sizes, with stories that not only thrill us but also make us smile.

If you're an experienced Game Master (GM) and have run traditional 5e games, nothing in this book should surprise you. For the most part, these are how I interpret the creatures of *Star Wars*, with a few of my own twists. Naturally, you can do with these monsters what you will. Nothing I say here is intended to curtail your creativity. 

## How to Use This Book
The best thing about being a GM is that you get to invent your own planet or setting and bring it to life, and nothing brings a *Star Wars* world to life more than the creatures that inhabit it. You might read a monster's entry and be spurred to create an adventure revolving around it, or you might have an awesome idea for a dungeon and need just the right monsters to populate it. That's where the *SW5e: Monster Manual* comes in handy.

The *SW5e: Monster Manual* is one of three books that form the foundation of the SW5e game, the other two being the *SW5e: Player's Handbook* and the core 5e Dungeon Master's Guide. The *SW5e: Monster Manual*, like the Dungeon Master's Guide, is a book for GMs. Use it to populate your D&D adventures with obnoxious gungans, profane aqualish, savage tuskens, mighty rancors, and a veritable horde of porgs.

Guidelines for creating encounters with monsters can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. That book also contains wandering monster tables and other goodies to help you use the monsters in this book in interesting ways, as well as advice for modifying monsters and creating your own.

## Breakdown
This book is broken down into four chapters: Beasts, Constructs, Droids, and Humanoids. Each chapter is briefly described below:

### Chapter 1: Beasts
Every planet in the galaxy has its own native creatures, and many creature have unique traits. Noteworthy creatures include the fearsome rancor, the placid dewback, the hardy tauntaun, or the obnoxious monkey-lizard.

### Chapter 2: Constructs
Constructs will encompass any kind of non-sentient machines that adventurers might encounter: turrets, vehicles, ships, etc. These often (but not always) utilize a unique mechanic called *piloted* that requires an active pilot for the construct to function.

### Chapter 3: Droids
The other side of the machine coin, droids will cover the sentient side. Droids come in five classifications, but most of the statblocks I generated will be the for combat-oriented ones.

### Chapter 4: Humanoids
The majority of the known galaxy is populated by some kind of humanoid. Most non-combat encounters, and many of the combat encounters, involve humanoids.

### Appendices
Two appendicies of all statblocks exist: one is sorted alphabetically, the other by Challenge Rating.

# Chapter 1: Beasts

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he beasts of *Star Wars* are one of the most<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; common creature types your players could encounter. Every planet has its own unique form of wildlife, offering potential roleplaying or combat opportunities. Iconic creatures such as a rancor, krayt dragon, or dewback would all fall under this category.

### Defining Features
Beasts don't have any uniform defining characteristics, per se. Generally, their combat abilities are more uniformly simple, both aggressively and defensively.

### Encounters with Beasts
Genereating encounters with beasts is usually a very simple CR calculation. Most beast types offer more than one CR option, depending on the age of the beast your players encounter.

Every planet has its own unique wildlife. While certain beasts are native to a single planet (like the rancor is native to Dathomir), others have remarkably similar cousins (like the Wampa). Additionally, some planets might have some obscure native beast that isn't replicated here. If you want to have such an encounter, either reskin a currently existing statblock appropriately or try generating your own.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances,<br> and Condition Immunities
Beasts vary drastically based on where they come from and their own statistics. Consequently, they have no uniform damage vulnerabilities or resistances, or condition immunities.

Banthas are a species of large, hairy mammals with sharp, spiraling horns. They are native to the desert planet Tatooine, though they are bred on many worlds throughout the galaxy. They are social herd<br> animals, and are often domesticated, and<br> used prominently, by Tusken Raiders as<br> mounts and companions.

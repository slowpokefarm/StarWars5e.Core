&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onditions alter a starship's capabilities in a variety<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ways and can arise as a result of a power, a starship feature, or some other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. 

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a starship, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A starship either has a condition or doesn't.

Any conditions that reference the ship also apply to any crew members when they take actions involving the ship. For instance, an ionized ship has disadvantage on attack rolls. Consequently, a deployed gunner would have disadvantage on attack rolls with a ship weapon, but not with their own weapons.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

#### Blinded
- A blinded ship can't see and automatically fails any ability check that relies on sight or the ship's sensors.
- Attack rolls against the ship have advantage, and the ship's attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Disabled
- A disabled ship can't communicate with external sources more than 1,000 feet away.
- A disabled ship can't take actions or reactions.
- A disabled ship's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

#### Ionized
- An ionized starship has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

#### Invisible
- An invisible starship is impossible to see without the aid of powers or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the starship is heavily obscured. The starship's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

#### Shocked
- A shocked starship's speed is reduced by half.
- The starship can't take reactions.

#### Stalled
- A stalled ship is disabled (see the condition).
- Any active features controlled by the ship, such as a Tractor Beam or Gravity Well Projector, automatically end.
- The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.

#### Stunned
- A stunned ship's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.

#### System Damage
Some special abilities, or when certain conditions are met, cause a ship to sustain a special condition called system damage. such as and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called system damage. System damage is measured in six levels. An effect can give a starship one or more levels of system damage, as specified in the effect's description.

|Level|Effect|
|:--:|:--|
|1|Disadvantage on ability checks|
|2|Flying speed halved and turning speed doubled|
|3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
|4|Hit point maximum, shield point maximum, and shield regeneration rate halved|
|5|Ship becomes permanently "used" (see the condition)|
|6|Ship suffers catastrophic power failure. All primary systems fail.|

If a ship with system damage suffers another effect that causes system damage, its current level of system damage increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A ship suffers the effect of its current level of system damage as well as all lower levels. For example, a ship suffering level 2 system damage has its flying speed halved, turning speed doubled, and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes system damage reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all system damage effects (except for "used") ending if a ship's system damage level is reduced below 1.

Finishing maintenance reduces a ship's system damage level by 1.

#### Tractored
- A tractored ship's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the tractoring ship is disabled (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the tractored ship from the reach of the tractoring ship or effect.

#### Used
- A used starship's value is reduced by half.
- When a deployed crew member on a used starship rolls a 1 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they must make a destruction saving throw. If the roll is 10 or higher, they succeed. On a failure, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/4mYR4C0.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haracters are nothing without their ships, which<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serve as a great source of inspiration and motivation for their adventures. The starship can even be the adventure itself.

The first step is acquisition.

## Acquiring a Ship
Many parties might see fit to merely obtain passage on a vessel as a part of their adventures, and there's nothing wrong with that. Others will want to obtain their own ships as fast as possible as it is a core component to their character. It is at the discretion of the GM to determine when a party should obtain their first starship using one of the following options.

### Joining a Faction
Joining a large faction, such as the Galactic Republic or the Empire might merit the acquisition of a personal starship. Generally, the faction still owns the ship and allows the party to use it as long as they are in accordance with the faction's wishes. Refusing missions or violating the faction's rule may lead to disavowment, pursuit, and eventual repossession of the ship. 

### Shipjacking
The most nefarious (and frankly most enjoyable) way to acquire a starship is to steal one. Shipjacking is an old and extremely dangerous profession. Starport authorities (as well as the original owners) are constantly on the lookout for stolen ships, and if the heroes fail to adequately falsify documentation identifying themselves as the ship's owners, they can find themself in an uncomfortable position.

### Purchasing
The most common method of acquiring a ship is by purchasing. The cost of a brand new "stock" starship can be found below, on the Starship Size Stock Cost table.

#### Starship Size Stock Cost
| Starship Size | Tier 0 Cost&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|:----:|----:|
| Tiny  | 10,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Small  | 50,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Medium  | 100,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Large  | 1,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Huge | 100,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Gargantuan | 1,000,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|

How the players afford the ship varies as well. They may be patient, earning the credits to make the purchase over time. Alternatively, they might seek a backer, or a loan through a financial institution.

> Newly constructed starships come with a number of vacant modification slots, which can be filled with modifications, which are discussed in Chapter 4.

\columnbreak

#### Financing
The party could seek the assistance of a financial institute to purchase a starship. Generally, the bank will require 20% of the starship's cost as a down payment, with monthly payments equal to 2% of the cost for the following five years. 

#### A Wealthy Sponsor
Alternatively, the party may be granted the favor of working for a specific wealthy individual, such as a rich aristocrat. Convincing such an individual to finance you, however, can be quite the adventure in-and-of itself. Generally you can only obtain a sponsor if you can prove the relationship will be mutually beneficial.

#### Loan Sharks
As a less appealing (but potentially more interesting) option, the party could seek out a loan shark or an affluent gangster to finance a ship's acquisition. This usually requires less money up front, but requires steeper loan payments (typically 10% of the starship's cost each month for 3 years).

### Building a Ship
Some players might prefer to build a ship instead. Building a ship is generally cheaper than buying it, but requires substantially more effort and patience; building takes time and necessitates use of a shipyard and a substantial workforce. If players elect to build a stock starship instead of purchasing one, it requires half the cost of the finished ship in facilities, labor costs, and raw materials. Additionally, it requires a minimum workforce as shown below on the Starship Size Construction Workforce table.

#### Starship Size Construction Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 3 |
| Small  | 5 |
| Medium  | 10 |
| Large  | 100 |
| Huge | 1,000 |
| Gargantuan | 10,000 |

The amount of time it takes to build a ship depends on the size of the ship and the size of the workforce, calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("starship size construction cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to build a Small ship, with a workforce of 5, would take 20 days. To build a Huge ship, with a workforce of 1,000, however, would take 200 days [100,000,000 / (500 x 1,000)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | STARSHIPS</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Upgrading a Starship
Once the party has acquired a ship, they can upgrade it over time. Upgrading a ship is a matter of workforce, time, and skill. This assumes the starship you are upgrading is otherwise fully functional (has no missing hit points or damaged systems), the requisite resources and tools are freely available, and you are docked at a spaceport or shipyard. Under less optimal conditions the time, money and skill required could be increased by as much as 100%, and the GM may decide that an upgrade is impossible in these circumstances.

In addition to the cost of modifications and equipment, players can invest credits into their starships, eventually hitting certain thresholds that improve the tier of the ship.  Achieving higher tiers requires scarcer materials, restricted schematics, and master craftsmen; consequently, it costs more credits As a player increases the tier of their starship, they unlock additional Hit Dice, additional modification slots, and unique size-specific features. The number of credits a party must invest in their ship varies based on the tier they are trying to obtain, as show below in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

#### Base Upgrade Cost by Tier
| Starship Tier | Cost in Credits |
|:----:|:----:|
| 1 | 3,900 |
| 2 | 77,500 |
| 3 | 297,000 |
| 4 | 620,000 |
| 5 | 1,150,000 |

### Cost Modifiers
It costs more to upgrade the hull of a capital ship than the hull of a starfighter; bigger starships are simply costlier to improve. Consequently, each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table below, which is multiplied by the value for that tier in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

#### Starship Size Upgrade Cost
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 10 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 100 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 1,000 |

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from Tier 0 to Tier 1, it costs 3,900 credits. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, however, it costs 29,700,000 (297,000 x 100).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Upgrade Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform these upgrades. For a Small ship, a single person can do everything necessary (though additional workers will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Upgrade Workforce table below.

#### Starship Size Upgrade Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 2 |
| Small  | 3 |
| Medium  | 5 |
| Large  | 50 |
| Huge | 500 |
| Gargantuan | 5,000 |

### Upgrade Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be upgraded in no more than a week's time. However, upgrading a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("base upgrade cost by tier" x "starship size upgrade cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from tier 0 to tier 1, with a workforce of 3, would take 2.6 days. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, with a workforce of 500, however, would take 118.8 days [(297,000 x 100) / (500 x 500)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

> Some starship features are only usable once per round. Once they have been used by a deployed crew member, they are not available for use again until the start of that crew member's next turn.

### Starship Tier Features
Once players have upgraded a ship to tier 1 or higher, they unlock additional features, determined by the ship's size.

#### Ability Score Improvement
You can increase your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. At 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier you may increase one ability score of your choice by 1.

### Astromech Synergy
Also at 1st tier, your starship gains an interface slot suited for an astromech droid. 

While an astromech droid occupies the interface slot, they function as a deployed crew member, rolling their own initiative and taking their own actions as long as they are not incapacitated. Additionally, deployed crew members can draw on it to enhance one action they take. When a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can roll an Astromech Synergy die, which is a d4, and add it to the roll. This feature can only be used by one deployed crew member, and it can only be used once per round.

Your ship's Astromech Synergy die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | STARSHIPS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Bomber
Your ship gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

#### Interceptor
Your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.

#### Shuttle
Your ship gains one suite system of your choice, which does not count against its total modifications. Your Starship Size Suite Capacity is 2. If the capacity of a suite would be less than 1, it is 1 for you.

#### Strike Fighter
Your ship gains a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and save DCs of its ship weapons.

### Retro Thrusters
Also at 2nd tier, when an attacker that a deployed pilot or operator can see deals damage to your ship with a weapon, they can use their reaction to immediately move the ship up to 50 feet in a direction of their choice, halving the damage your ship takes. The orientation of the ship does not change.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Versatile Snubfighter
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Maneuvering Jets
Also at 3rd tier, your ship can add half of its Dexterity modifier (rounded down, minimum of one) to its armor class.

\columnbreak

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Bomber
Starships two or more sizes larger than you have disadvantage on saving throws against your tertiary and quaternary weapons.

#### Interceptor

Also at 4th tier, your ship can be pushed beyond its normal limits for a moment. On their turn, a deployed crew member can take one additional action on top of their regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Paragon Snubfighter
As of 5th tier, your starship is a the best in its class. Your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score increases by 2. Its maximum for this score increases by 2.

### A Leaf on the Wind
Also at 5th tier, when your ship, or a deployed crew member, makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, a deployed crew member can use their reaction to treat the amount rolled on the d20 as a 20.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

## Medium Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The freighter shudders with the blasts of cannon fire. Despite</span> its maneuvers, the pilot can't quite shake the pursuit. Finally, just as the ship's shields dissipate, the pilot makes the gut call, jettisoning the illicit cargo. As it distracts and hampers the followers, the freighter shifts power to the thrusters and quickly flies away.

As the pirates activate their tractor beam to attempt to capture the weaponless frigate and its exotic wares, the gunboat escort intercedes. It flies in the line of the tractor, breaking the lock on the frigate, and unleashes a terrible volley of cannon fire. The pirates, incapable of standing such a salvo, disable the tractor beam and retreat.

The atmosphere set, the captain invites his guests into the cantina. Fully aware of the effect the opulent room has on the unprepared, he gestures for the starry-eyed visitors to sit across from him. He indicates for the server to bring drinks, as he casually leans back and puts his feet on the table, confident that this deal will go in his favor.

Medium ships are the bread and butter of the close-knit group. They are large enough to accommodate all of the immediate needs of a crew, while at the same time being small enough to feel cozy.

## Starship Features

#### Ability Scores
___
- **Strength at Tier 0:** 12 (+1)

### Evasive Maneuvers
Also at 1st tier, when a deployed pilot rolls for initiative, they can immediately move the ship. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

The amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a d4, and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.

Your ship's Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | STARSHIPS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

### Versatile Transport
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Hold Together
Also at 3rd tier, when your ship takes damage while at 0 hit points, it makes a Destruction saving throw, instead of automatically failing.

\columnbreak

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Freighter
When your ship fails a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, a deployed crew member can use their reaction to jettison some of the cargo stored in its storage compartments. If you jettison at least 50 tons of cargo, you can reroll the saving throw and must use the new roll. If you jettison at least 75 tons of cargo, however, you instead automatically succeed on the saving throw. Additionally, the area in a line 300 feet long and 100 feet wide behind your ship becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.

#### Gunboat
Once per round, a deployed gunner can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship attack.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Paragon Transport
As of 5th tier, your starship is a the best in its class. Two of your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (your choice) increases by 2. Its maximum for these scores increases by 2.

### Best Ship in the 'Verse
Also at 5th tier, as an action, a deployed crew member can give the ship resistance to unenhanced damage from ship weapons for 1 minute.

This effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

As a reaction to being hit with an attack roll from a Large or larger ship, a deployed pilot can use their reaction to immediately move the ship forward an amount equal to half its flying speed (rounded down) and then roll a Blockade Runner die, which is a d4, and subtract it from the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.

Your ship's Blockade Runner die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

## Huge Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The battleship's shields flickers as it absorbs the blows of the</span>  attacking fighters. It continues inexorably past them, approaching the fragile medical frigate they scramble to protect, before unleashing a fierce volley and snapping it in half.

As the carrier leaves hyperspace, snubfighters deploy in formations and move to intercept. Before the enemy craft has the opportunity to respond, the fighters fall upon them, quickly decimating their ranks.

With the command given, the operator activates the interdictor's gravity well projectors. Accompanied by a low-pitched hum, the gravity well projectors power up. Minutes pass for the ship uneventfully, until finally a frigate lurches unceremoniously out of hyperspace into realspace in front of them. The ship then activates its tractor beam, trapping its quarry.

Huge starships, regardless of their specific purpose, are the backbone of any military. They provide a mobile base of operations and function as a staging ground for the faction that controls them.

<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The smaller ships retreat into the shadow of the blockade</span> ship, fleeing an overwhelming foe. As the dreadnoughts shields envelope them, they quickly turn and spring on their pursuers, utilizing the bulwarks shields as they unleash all of the firepower they have to bear.

In the center of the fleet, the command ship surveys the battlefield. Wherever the line wavers, the command ship quickly directs ships to reinforce. Finally, the formations of the enemy flag, and the command ship directs the fleet to capitalize on their failure.

At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship 
Your ship gains the Emergency Generator and Power Backup modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, your ships shields extend further around it. Whenever a friendly ship would take damage while within 500 feet of your ship, if the source of that damage is more than 500 feet away from your ship and your ship's shields are active, your ship's shields instead take that damage. If the damage reduces your ship's shields to 0, the protected ship takes any remaining damage.

On a failed save, affected crew members have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Versatile Dreadnought
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 5 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

\columnbreak

### Superweapon
Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a superweapon. As an action, a deployed operator can activate the superweapon, which has a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. When activated, a beam of destructive energy forming a line 10,000 feet long and 100 feet wide blasts from the weapon. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 10d10 energy damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship
Your ship's shield regeneration rate doubles.

#### Command Ship
A deployed coordinator can, as an action, issue an order to a Huge or smaller ship. That ship can immediately move up to its flying speed, and up to five deployed crew members on that ship can use their reaction to immediately take an action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

#### Researcher 
When you use your ship's Superweapon, you can alter its functionality. Instead of dealing damage, ships who fail a saving throw are blinded, shocked, and shocked for 1 minute. Ships who succeed on the saving throw suffer these effects until the start of the deployed operator's next turn, instead.

#### Warship
When a deployed gunner on your ship rolls the maximum on a damage die for a ship weapon, they can roll an additional die.

### Citadel
Also at 4th tier, the capacity for all of your suites is doubled. Additionally, your starship's maximum capacity for fuel and consumables doubles, and civilians, crew members, and troopers aboard your starship have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid Exhaustion.

- Your ship has resistance to all damage.
- Your ship's ship attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

This effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

## Variant: Space Stations
Players may decide they want to invest in a space station. Only size categories Large and larger are appropriate for space stations. If players elect to own a space station instead of—or in addition to—a starship, use the following rules. 

#### Armor Class
When calculating a space station's armor class, use the operator's Technology instead of of the pilot's Piloting, by taking the station's size base armor class (as shown in the Starship Size Base Armor Class table on page 56), add the deployed operator's Intelligence (Technology) modifier, and any applicable bonuses. For example, a Large station has a base armor class of 7. If the operator has an Intelligence of 16, a proficiency bonus of +2, proficiency in Technology, and the station is using deflection armor, his station has an armor class of 12. You do not require proficiency in Technology to attempt to operate a space station.

#### Stock Modifications
Your space station comes with the Central Computer universal system in addition to the other stock modifications.

#### Flying Speed and Turning Speed
The station's flying speed become 50 feet and it's turning speed becomes 100 feet, regardless of any bonuses or penalties. The station's flying speed and turning speed can never be increased or decreased.

#### Hit Points Per Hit Die
For each Hit Die a space station has, it gains 2 additional hit points.

#### Hyperspace Travel
Your travel time in hyperspace is doubled.

#### Modification Slots at Tier 0
The modification slots at tier 0 doubles. For instance, while a Large ship has 15 modification slots at tier 0, a Large station instead has 30 modification slots.

#### Starship Size Maximum Suites
The maximum number of suites a station can have (as shown in the Starship Size Maximum Suites table on page 43) doubles. For instance, while a Large ship has a maximum of 8 suites, a Large station instead has a maximum of 16 suites.

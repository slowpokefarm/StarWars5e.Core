<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/XSXXqiB.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:71px;width:39px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iving through an asteroid field, docking in a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space port, or simply exploring the wild blue yonder, are the things that *Star Wars* adventures are made of. Your character, with the aid of their ship, might explore wild space, undertake dangerous smuggling missions, or dispatch pirate ships. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This chapter covers the basics of adventuring in space, from the mechanics of movement to the acquisition of the ship itself. The rules for maintenance are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your characters might pursue between adventures.

Whether adventurers are exploring uncharted territories or a complicated relationship with a criminal organization, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book's introduction:

___

&emsp;**1. The GM describes the environment.**

**2. The players describe what they want to do.**

**3. The GM narrates the results of their actions.**

___

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore enclave corridors or wilderness regions.

The GM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

## Ship Registration
Pilots are required to register their starships with the Bureau of Ships and Services (or BoSS). Additionally, at registration, the pilot must acquire an Operating License at the cost of 1,000 credits. To be eligible for this license they must pass a written piloting test, which requires a DC 15 Intelligence (Piloting) check.

### Transponder Codes
When ships are created, they are assigned a unique signal called a transponder code. Once registered with the BoSS, this signal can be used to identify that ship using the BoSS database. The transponder code can be used to identify a ship's owner, designation, make and model, as well as any registered modifications. Additionally, a transponder code can be used to access the ship's ownership history.

The transponder code is built into the ship's sublight engines, making any attempt to remove or alter it incredibly difficult; failing an attempt could damage or destroy a ship's engines.

> ##### The Bureau of Ships and Services
> The Bureau of Ships and Services (BoSS) is a long-standing, impartial, third-party galactic organization that manages all data related to the massive number of starships present in the galaxy. The BoSS has stood for thousands of years due to their ability to stay neutral in conflicts.
>
> Information on a ship's ownership and its captains certifications are kept on file at the BoSS at all times. The data is distributed to spaceports upon request, but it is an expensive and slow process. As a result of this, smaller spaceports rarely update their registries more than once a year.
>
> The security on BoSS computer systems is of the highest caliber money can buy, making it almost impossible to access without proper authorization codes.

## Communications
Starships are equipped with basic systems that allow for communication in realspace. Typically, starship communications systems are limited to contact ships and planets within the same system, although boosters and specialized radios can reach up to several light-years. Opening a channel to a willing recipient is simply a matter of pinging their ship. They will receive a notification and can respond, opening the lines of communication.

### HoloNet
The Holonet is an instantaneous communication system that allows planets to stay in contact despite the vast distances between them. A HoloNet transceiver transmits and receives information through hyperspace, allowing information to travel millions of times faster than the speed of light. Hyperwave transceivers are embedded at strategic locations, constantly relaying information throughout the galaxy. This networks allows for instantaneous three-dimensional holographic communications at virtually any distance, making it one of the primary means of communication. Government agencies, such as the military, typically maintain their own encrypted circuits on the HoloNet. Some experienced slicers have been able to access these encrypted channels, though it required access to a government compound for the requisite codes.

### METOSP (Message to Spacers)
Upon arrival in a star system, most starships immediately connect to a specialized frequency responsible for communicating with incoming and outbound ships, called Message to Spacers, or METOSP. The METOSP message typically conveys a repeated greeting with information about flight hazards (such as blockades, weather, debris, or collisions) and relevant local regulations or customs (such as embargoes, tariffs, or landing procedures). All METOSPs are broadcast in Galactic Basic, though some worlds also broadcast in their native language. A METOSP provides pilots with contact information for spaceport control as well as information on landing patterns and traffic lanes. Most METOSPs are brief, repeating messages that refer listeners to other channels for specific information.

### Planetary Information Channels
Most planets also provide incoming space traffic with basic computer communication channels. These channels connect the ship to planetary information networks that provide everything from communications directory assistance to tourism information and planetary maps. Planetary information channels allow use of the Technology skill to access information relevant to the planet, and it possible for a slicer to access other functions.

## Time
In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In an enclosed environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to navigate an asteroid field, a minute to dock in a space port, and a good 10 minutes to clear customs.

While traveling in realspace, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach a pirate stronghold on the other side of the planet travel those 150 miles in just over an hour.

In hyerspace, however, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Tatooine to Kashyyk, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a pirate ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9.

## Movement and Travel
There are two significant travel types: Realspace and Hyperspace. 

\columnbreak

### Travel in Realspace
All starships have sublight engines that propel them through realspace, using them when taking off, landing, or flying within a gravity sphere. Coupled with an ion drive, ships are capable of incredible acceleration. 

When traveling in realspace, the GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You fly around the planet, reaching the stronghold late in the evening." 

Sometimes it's important, though, to know how far, how fast, and how maneuverable your ship is in a short window of time. Starships come equipped with two speeds: **flying speed** and **turning speed**. 

#### Flying Speed
**Flying speed** is how far your ship can travel in a single round. It is expressed in feet. For every foot your ship travels, it expends one foot from its speed.

#### Turning Speed
**Turning speed** determines how maneuverable your ship is. In order for your ship to turn 90 degrees, you must spend an amount of your **flying speed**. The amount you must spend equals your **turning speed**. For instance, if your ship has a **flying speed** of 350 feet, and a **turning speed** of 100 feet, you can travel 150 feet in a straight line, spending 150 feet of your **flying speed**, and then turn 90 degrees to starboard, spending 100 feet of your **flying speed**, leaving 100 feet of movement remaining.

A ship can turn more or less than 90 degrees on its turn, by spending a proportionate amount of movement.

If a ship's **turning speed** exceeds its **flying speed**, treat its **turning speed** as equal to its **flying speed**.

#### Travel Pace
While traveling in realspace, a starship can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace. While traveling at a fast pace, your starship's flying speed is doubled, but your starship—and its crew—have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks. While traveling at a slow pace, your flying speed is halved, but you can travel stealthily. A fast pace makes a ship less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the "Activity While Traveling" section later in this chapter for more information).

You can use the following Sample Realspace Travel Times table to determine travel times in realspace for an average starship traveling at a normal pace.

#### Sample Realspace Travel Times
|Distance|Time Required|
|:--|--:|
|Surface of planet to orbit|1-5 minutes|
|Orbit to safe hyperspace jump distance|1 minute|
|Orbit to planet's moon|10-30 minutes|
|Orbit to another planet in the same system|2-6 hours|
|Orbit to outer edge of system|12-24 hours|

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Difficult Terrain
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume unobstructed terrain. But adventurers often face narrow canyons, tight formations, or other difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Activity While Traveling
As adventurers travel on their starship, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.

#### Deployment Order
While traveling, adventurers want to determine who is deployed where.

A deployment order makes it easier to determine which characters can spot hidden enemies or anomalies, and which ones are the closest to their station in case a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the cockpit, a gunner station, or a relevant suite. The closer they are to their preferred deployment, the less time they have to spend getting to it.

> A ship might encounter a hostile ship while some crew members are resting or relaxing instead of deployed. It is up to the GM to determine how long it takes each crew member to deploy.

#### Stealth
While traveling at a slow pace, the starship can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other starships they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

#### Noticing Threats
Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the starship notices a hidden threat. The GM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by deployed characters. For example, as the characters are traveling through an asteroid field, the GM might decide that only those characters deployed in a rear-facing deployment have a chance to spot a stealthy starship following the group, while characters deployed elsewhere cannot. While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.

***Encountering Starships.*** If the GM determines that the adventurers encounter another starship while they're traveling, it's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a dialogue, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.

***Surprising Foes.*** If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the GM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.

\columnbreak

#### Other Activities
Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the GM's permission.

***Navigate.*** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making an Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)

***Maintain a Map.*** The character can maintain a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

***Track.*** A character can follow the tracks of another starship, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has rules for tracking.)

> ##### Splitting Up the Party
> Splitting up the party is more difficult when your party only has one ship. Should they acquire a fleet of their own, however, they can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own deployment order.
>
> The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy ships moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier ships would alert. A X-wing moving at a slow pace is much harder to detect than the Corellian Corvette they leave behind.

### Travel in Hyperspace
The fastest way to travel long distances in space is through hyperspace. When a starship engages its hyperdrive, it accelerates beyond the speed of light and enters hyperspace. A starship in hyperspace can't communicate with ships in realspace. It is effectively cut off from realspace while in hyperspace.

Large objects that generate significant gravity, such as planets and stars, produce what is known as a "mass shadow" that projects into hyerspace. Collision with a mass shadow can have catastrophic repercussions. Hyperdrives have built-in safeguards that prevent a ship from jumping to hyperspace while inside of a mass shadow, causing a ship to immediately revert to realspace if the mass shadow is detected. Interdiction vesssels use gravity well generators to keep ships from activating their hyperdrives. Some pirates have been known to drag asteroids into hyperspace lanes in order to drag prey out of hyperspace.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Travel Pace
While traveling in hyperspace, a starship travels at a set speed as determined by the classification of the hyperdrive. A class 1 hyperdrive travels at hyperspeed, while a class 2 hyperdrive travels at half hyperspeed, and a class .5 hyperdrive travels at twice hyperspeed. 

The galaxy at large is divided into territories, which are in turn subdivided into sectors. Traveling from one planet to another in the same sector takes less time than traveling from one planet to another in a different sector of the same territory. Consequently, traveling to a planet in a different territory takes even longer.

You can use the following Sample Hyperspace Travel Times table below to determine travel times. These times assume a class 1 hyperdrive.

#### Sample Hyperspace Travel Times
|Distance|Time Required|
|:--|--:|
|Planet in same sector|1-2 days|
|Planet in different sector in same territory|3-6 days|
|Planet in different territory|7-14 days|

#### Detecting Hyperspace Travel
When a starship enters or exits hyperspace, it generates a short burst of radiation. Any facility with adequate sensor arrays can detect this radiation burst with a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check. Success would indicate that a ship entered or exited the system as well as the point of arrival or departure. If the result of the check is over 25, the angle of departure can be determined, indicating possible destinations.

#### Astrogation
Plotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations; normally, only a truly brilliant individual can perform this feat unaided. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation. A deployed operator can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence check. The DC of the check is determined by how long they spent calculating, as shown below in the Astrogation Time Taken table.

#### Astrogation Time Taken
|Time Taken|DC|
|:--|:--:|
|10 minutes|10|
|1 minute|20|
|6 seconds|30|

Additionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.

On a success, the operator accurately charts the hyperspace jump. Failing this check, however, results in a hyperspace mishap (see the Hyerspace Mishaps table below).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;**The BoSS:** In addition to their duties of regulating information regarding ship ownership, they BoSS also maintains a database of astrogation information. Each time a ship docks in a major spaceport, they can update their astrogation data for a 150 credit fee. Astrogation data is routinely updated and is rarely more than a week old.

#### Hyperspace Hazards
Traveling through hyperspace can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below.

#### Hyperspace Mishaps
|D20&emsp;|Result|
|:--:|:--|
|1-5|Internal computer systems overload. Technology checks aboard the starship are made with disadvantage until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|6-10|Intense gravity warps the vessel's structual integrity. Piloting checks are made with disadvantage until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|11-15|Starship collides with small debris. The ship's hull immediately takes kinetic damage equal to one-tenth of its max HP, and shields regenerate at half their normal rate until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|16-19|The hyperdrive suffers a catastrophic failure, and is rendered unusable until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|20|Reroll on the above table twice|

### Landing Gear
All ships, regardless of size, come with integrated landing gear, complete with magnetic clamps. A ship can use its landing gear to bind itself another ship of a larger size. The landing gear can be engaged remotely from the cockpit, or manually in the event of primary system failure.

### Movement in Zero Gravity
In some circumstances, such as prolonged power failure, or movement in space outside of the ship, a character might find themselves moving in zero gravity.

While in zero gravity, a character has a flying speed equal to their walking speed, and zero gravity is treated as difficult terrain.

If a character already had a flying speed, they instead do not treat zero gravity as difficult terrain.

## Crew Capacity
Ships have a minimum and maximum crew capacity determined by their size, modifications, and determined use. Most Small fighters, for instance, have a single crew member controlling all aspects of the ship. Medium ships, however, might have a crew of half a dozen, while larger ships have crews in the hundreds to hundreds of thousands. Regardless, ships have a minimum number of required crew members, as shown below on the Starship Size Minimum Crew table.

#### Starship Size Minimum Crew
|Starship Size|Minimum Crew|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|—|
|Small|1|
|Medium|1|
|Large|200|
|Huge|4,000|
|Gargantuan|80,000|

The number of crew members that actively participate in combat, however, is much smaller. For coordinators, mechanics, operators, and pilots, each ship should only have one actively deployed crew member at a time. On ships where multiple people fill these roles, the chiefest and most experienced among them should be considered the deployed crew member for that role.

For gunners, the maximum number is equal to the number of hardpoints the ship has.

### Deployed
When a character is manning a deployment, they are considered deployed. A character can man multiple deployments simultaneously, provided they can access the controls for each deployment. For instance, in a Small ship, a single character can fulfill all five deployments simultaneously, since they can reach everything without moving. In a Medium ship, however, a single character can function as both pilot and operator, but probably can't reach the controls for the ship's weapons or the ship's engines to function as a gunner or mechanic. In Large and larger ships, most deployment stations are spread out so it's difficult for a deployed crew member to man more than one deployment.

While deployed in only one deployment, it is assumed you can have access to all features of that deployment.

\columnbreak

## The Environment
Starship exploration involves delving into the potentially dangerous, uncharted territory. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers, and their ships, interact with the environment. The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.

### Vision and Light
The most fundamental tasks of starfaring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, and hitting an enemy ship in combat, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, dust clouds, or electrical storms, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area-such as darkness, opaque gases, or dense asteroids-blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A).

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. 

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, and surrounding darkness. 

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. 

#### Blindsight
A deployed operator on a starship equipped with an enhanced scanner can perceive their surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 

#### Truesight
More advanced scanners offer truesight, allowing a deployed operator to detect starships that are completely invisible. Truesight allows a starship's scanners to automatically detect visual illusions and the deployed operator succeed on saving throws against them.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Repairs and Maintenance  
Over time, wear and tear on a ship accrues, forcing adventurers to temporarily abandon their pursuits to conduct repairs, and eventually maintenance. 

### Repairs
As long as a ship has a deployed mechanic, they can conduct makeshift repairs without having to dock the ship. Conducting repairs  requires a workforce as shown in the Starship Size Equipment Workforce table on page 55, and takes an amount of time depending on the size of starship, as shown in the Starship Size Repair Time table below.

#### Starship Size Repair Time
|Starship Size|Time&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny|1 hour|
|Small|2 hours|
|Medium|8 hours|
|Large|1 day|
|Huge|2 days|
|Gargantuan|1 week|

If conducting repairs is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting powers, or similar adventuring activity—the workforce must begin repairs again for the ship to gain any benefit from it.

Once repairs are conducted, a deployed mechanic can attempt to spend one or more Hit Dice, up to the starship's maximum number of Hit Dice, by making an Intelligence (Mechanic's kit) check. On a roll of 10 or less, you roll the Hit Die twice and take the lesser amount. On a roll of 11 to 20, you roll the Hit Die normally. On a roll of 21 or higher, you roll the Hit Die twice and take the greater amount.

For each Hit Dice spent in this way, the mechanic rolls the the die and adds the ship's Constitution modifier to it. The starship regains hit points equal to the total. The mechanic can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 

### Maintenance
Maintenance is a period of extended downtime that requires docking at a spaceport or shipyard. Maintenance costs a number of credits proportionate to the number of hit points missing. The amount is 10 credits per hit point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22. Conducting maintenance requires a workforce as shown in the Starship Size Upgrade Workforce table on page 22, and takes an amount of time depending on the size of starship, as shown in the Starship Size Maintenance Time table below.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

#### Starship Size Maintenance Time
|Starship Size|Time&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny|4 hours|
|Small|8 hours|
|Medium|1 day|
|Large|3 days|
|Huge|1 week|
|Gargantuan|1 month|

If conducting maintenance is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting powers, or similar adventuring activity—the workforce must begin maintenance again for the ship to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of maintenance, a ship regains all lost hit points and Hit Dice, and its system damage level is reduced by 1. 

#### Repairing the "Used" Condition
If the ship was "used" at the start of maintenance, the foremost mechanic can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check. On a success, the cost of maintenance is increased, and the ship is no longer "used".

Repairing "used" costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hit points. The amount is 10 credits per hit point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22. 

### Primary System Failure
In some instances, primary systems can experience failure. When primary systems fail, an integrated emergency back up will activate. This back up can continue running the starship, provided there is adequate fuel, for 24 hours. At the end of the 24-hour period, primary systems fail, causing all electrical systems, including life support to fail. 

Once a ship's primary systems, all functionality of the ship ceases to function. If the ship can be towed to a shipyard, it can still be repaired, however.

#### Repairing Primary Systems
If the ship's primary systems had failed at the start of maintenance, they can be repaired during that maintenance, increasing the cost but not the time.

Repairing primary systems costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hit points. The amount is 10 credits per hit point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22.

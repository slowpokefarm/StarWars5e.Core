&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ix abilities provide a quick description of</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every ship's, and her crew's, physical and mental<br> characteristics:<br>

___

- **Strength**, measuring the output of the ship's reactor
- **Dexterity**, measuring the maneuverability of the ship's thrusters
- **Constitution**, measuring the durability of the ship's hull
- **Intelligence**, measuring the crew's reasoning and memory 
- **Wisdom**, measuring the crew's awareness and intuition
- **Charisma**, measuring the crew's force of personality

___

Is a ship indomitable, and her crew insightful? Fast and frightening? Nimble and notorious? Ability scores define these qualities—a ship and her crew's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers
Each of a ship and her crew's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a ship's modification, or the crew's training, in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal average, but many ships and crew members are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a ship or crew usually reaches. Some can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and capital ships can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes a special ability or power tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the iktotchi's Precognition trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if an iktotchi has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the iktotchi could use the Precognition trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or powers. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

## Proficiency Bonus
Ships do not have a proficiency bonus. Instead, when a feature references a proficiency bonus, instead use the proficiency bonus of the character manning the relevant deployment. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying O by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

### Expertise
Certain features, such as the Expertise class feature or Ace Pilot feat, let you double your proficiency bonus with a given skill or tool proficiency, granting expertise in that skill or tool. As usual, you can only gain expertise in a skill or tool once.

## Ability Checks
An ability check represents a ship's ability to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a ship, or a crew member, attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the 6 abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the ship, or crew member, overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the ship or crew member makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

When making an ability check that involves Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you use the ship's score instead of your own, as dictated by logic.

### Contests
Sometimes one ship's or crew member's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to pass through a narrow gap simultaneously. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a ship's gravity projector tries to prevent another ship from jumping to hyperspace. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That ship or crew member either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two ship tie in a contest to pass through a narrow gap, neither ship makes it. In a contest between a ship's gravity generator tries to prevent another ship from jumping to hyperspace, a tie means that the second ship fails to jump.

|Task Difficulty|DC|
|:--|:--:|
|Very easy|	5|
|Easy|	10|
|Medium|	15|
|Hard	|20|
|Very hard	|25|
|Nearly impossible|	30|

## Using Each Ability
Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength
Strength measures the power of a ship's reactor.

#### Strength Checks
Your GM may call for Strength checks when you undergo interactions not covered by skills, such as trying to push through a malleable obstruction like a net.

#### Strength Saving Throws
Certain features, such as a Tractor Beam, call for a Strength saving throw. When you make a Strength saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Strength modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficient in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiency bonus to the result of the roll.

#### Damage Rolls
You add your ship's Strength modifier to ship weapon damage rolls.

#### Flying Speed
Your ship's flying speed is determined by a relationship between it's Strength and Constitution modifiers and its base flying speed, as shown below in the Starship Size Base Flying Speed table below.

#### Starship Size Base Flying Speed
|Starship Size|Base Flying Speed|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|400 ft.|
|Small|350 ft.|
|Medium|300 ft.|
|Large|250 ft.|
|Huge|200 ft.|
|Gargantuan|150 ft.|

To calculate a ship's flying speed, use the following formula:

___

<div align='center'>

**flying speed (in feet) = "starship size base flying speed" + 50 x ("Strength modifier" - "Constitution modifier")**

</div>

___

For instance, a Small ship with a Strength and Constitution modifier of +0 has a flying speed of 350 feet. A Huge ship with a Strength modifier of +4 and a Constitution modifier of +3, however, has a flying speed of 250 feet [200 + 50 x (4 - 3)].

#### Weapon Hardpoints
A ship can have a maximum number of hardpoints equal to its Strength score.

### Dexterity
Dexterity measures the maneuverability of a ship, as determined by its thrusters.

#### Dexterity Checks
Your GM may call for Dexterity checks when you undertake actions not covered by skills, such as maneuvering through a minefield.

#### Dexterity Saving Throws
Certain features, such as a Point Defense System, call for a Dexterity saving throw. When you make a Dexterity saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Dexterity modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficient in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiency bonus to the result of the roll.

> ##### Hiding
> When you try to hide your ship, the deployed pilot makes a Dexterity check. If they are proficient in both Stealth and Piloting, they can add their proficiency bonus to the roll.

#### Attack Rolls
You add your ship's Dexterity modifier to ship weapon attack rolls.

\columnbreak

#### Turning Speed
Your ship's turning speed is determined by a relationship between it's Dexterity and Constitution modifiers and its base turning speed, as shown below in the Starship Size Base Turning Speed table below.

#### Starship Size Base Turning Speed
|Starship Size|Base Turning Speed|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|300 ft.|
|Small|250 ft.|
|Medium|200 ft.|
|Large|150 ft.|
|Huge|100 ft.|
|Gargantuan|50 ft.|

To calculate a ship's flying speed, use the following formula:

___

<div align='center'>

**turning speed (in feet) = "starship size base turning speed" - 50 x ("Dexterity modifier" - "Constitution modifier")**

</div>

___

For instance, a Small ship with a Dexterity modifier of +3 and a Constitution modifier of +0 has a turning speed of 100 feet [250 - 50 x (3 - 0)]. A Huge ship with a Dexterity modifier of +0 and a Constitution modifier of +3, however, has a turning speed of 300 feet [150 - 50 x (0 - 3)].

### Constitution
Constitution represents the durability of a ship's hull.

#### Constitution Checks
Your GM may call for a Constitution check when you undergo interactions not covered by skills, such as overcoming the debilitating nature of an ion storm.

#### Constitution Saving Throws
Certain features, such as a Heavy Ion Cannon, call for a Constitution saving throw. When you make a Constitution saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Constitution modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficient in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiency bonus to the result of the roll.

#### Hit Points
Your ship's Constitution modifier contributes to its hit points. Typically, your ship adds its Constitution modifier to each Hit Die it rolls for its hit points.

If your ship's Constitution modifier changes, its hit point maximum changes as well, as though it had the new modifier from tier 0. For instance, if your Small ship's Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2 when it reaches 1st tier, you adjust its hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for tier 0, and then roll your hit points for tier 1 using your new modifier. Additionally, If some effect lowers your ship's Constitution score so as to reduce its Constitution modifier by 1, its hit point maximum is reduced as well.

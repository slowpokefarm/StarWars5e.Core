&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he *Star Wars* 5th Edition roleplaying game is about</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vast worlds populated populated by myriad sites and species. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, SW5e is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the expansive marketplace and seeing the different people's living their lives, and seeing how they might interact with the player's characters.

This book is designed to add another significant layer to your SW5e experience. The rules are designed to work alongside the traditional SW5e ruleset, and so an experienced player should have no trouble jumping right into the book. For the less experienced-or more curious-player, this Introduction discusses the basics.

**Game Master (GM):** As you enter the teeming marketplace in a disreputable sector of Nar Shaddaa, you see merchants of all types peddling wares, trying to entice the flowing traffic. As you move further into the crowd, one of the vendors catches your attention as they hail you.

**Drew (playing Dash):** I'm going to check out what they have for sale.

**Rickey (playing Vinto):** I'm going to keep an eye on the crowd to make sure our things aren't stolen.

**Erik (playing Kodo):** ...

Unlike a game of make-believe, SW5e gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' actions. Players roll dice to determine whether or not they can haggle for a better price, or to try to entice a merchant to accept work instead of credits for their goods. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

**Game Master (GM):** OK, one at a time. Rickey, you're checking the vendor's goods?

**Rickey:** Yeah. Do I see anything cool?

**GM:** Make an Intelligence check.

**Rickey:** Does my Investigation skill apply?

**GM:** Sure!

**Rickey (rolling a d20):** Eight. I hate this die!

**GM:** You see many trinkets and baubles but nothing catches your eye. And Drew, Dash is watching the crowd?

**Drew:** Yup!

**GM:** Okay. Eric, what's Kodo doing?

**Eric:** ...

In the *Star Wars* <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dungeons and Dragons</span> game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might join a faction, earning renown to increase their standing. They might become benevolent Jedi, malevolent Sith, ruthless bounty hunters, or scurrying scoundrels. If no faction catches their attention, they might instead create their own.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game's lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe a populous city, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they spend time buying and selling wares? Or will they look for work and entertainment in the city to make—or spend—their coin?

Then the GM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, SW5e is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a **campaign**. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each force defeated, each adventure completed, and each relic recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's rank in a faction, and the tier of the faction itself.

There's no winning and losing in the *Star Wars* <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dungeons and Dragons</span> game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, dispatched by a Sith lord. The party itself might meet its demise if it antagonizes a powerful and malicious faction. Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the players might choose (or be forced) to create new characters to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

## Explore Cities
One of the premier components of *Star Wars* 5th Edition, versus a traditional <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dungeons and Dragons</span> campaign, is the massive—almost overwhelming—number of planets. Each planet, and each city, hosts its own species, communities, factions, and traditions.

Each city hosts its own activities and factions. Players can choose to engage in these activities and join these factions if they so desire. Alternatively, players can instead form their own faction, recruiting other

\pagebreakNum

members to span across multiple cities, planets, or even the galaxy itself.

But if your players want to explore cities more indepth, this book is designed to those ends.

## Using This Book
*Wretched Hives* is divided into eight chapters.

**Chapters 1-4** are about spending time in cities, joining factions or creating your own, and how to run inter-faction conflict. It includes information on the major activities adventurers can engage in, as well as the boons they gain for joining a faction and maintaining a good standing. It also includes the rules for creating their own faction, if they so choose, with a step-by-step guide on how to build one. Lastly, it includes rules to help govern or inspire conflict between factions.

**Chapters 5-6** include new adventuring gear and customization options to help players realize their characters. It adds many new weapons and armor, including new properties, as well as all sorts of new adventuring gear, tools, and trade goods.

**Chapters 7-8** include the rules for enhanced items and tools, including how to implement them in your game and give tools more weight.

### Careful Checks
When you spend at least 10 minutes performing an activity that requires an ability check, that check has consequences for failure, and you don't have disadvantage on the check, you can choose to make that check carefully, colloquially called "taking 10". If you do so, you treat the check as if you had rolled a 10 on the d20. For instance, if you are crafting an item, during resolution you make an Intelligence check with the appropriate tools to determine your d100 Roll Modifier. Instead of rolling the d20, you can make a careful check and take 10, treating the check as if you'd rolled a 10, adding your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus, if you are proficient with the tools.

If you would have advantage on the check, you can instead take 15. 

### Crafting and Blueprints
If crafting is intended to be integral to your game, your player's characters should start with—and learn over time—the blueprints to craft enhanced items over time. All characters with proficiency in a tool know how to craft all unenhanced items that are governed by that tool. Additionally, a character with proficiency in a tool knows a number of blueprints equal to half their level (rounded up). A character with expertise instead knows a number of blueprints equal to their level. Whenever a character gains a level, they can exchange one blueprint they know for another one. A character can only know standard blueprints at 1st level, but can learn higher rarity blueprints as they gain increase in levels. A character can learn premium blueprints starting at 5th level, prototype at 9th level, advanced at 13th level, legendary at 17th level, and artifact at 20th level. As GM, you can allow player's to choose their own blueprints, or you can choose for them. If a character has proficiency in multiple tools, they 

\columnbreak

determine their known blueprints for each tool separately.

For instance, a 3rd-level character with proficiency in armstech's implements knows how to create all unenhanced blasters and vibroweapons, as well as up to two enhanced blasters or vibroweapons of standard rarity. A 5th-level character with expertise, however, can know up to five enhanced blasters or vibroweapons of premium rarity or lower.

### Engineers
Many engineer archetypes are built around modifying a specific item. For instance, armstech engineer is focused entirely on modifying and upgrading blasters and vibroweapons. If you have any of these engineers are the table, while using this book, you'll want to include the following rules:
- Engineer's class-specific chassis are not restricted to using mods of a certain rarity. For instance, if a 4th-level armstech engineer comes across an artifact rarity blaster modification, and they are skilled enough to install it, they can benefit from it.
- Engineer's class-specific chassis are not restricted to only one of each modification type, but if that modification adds a bonus, such as +1 to attack rolls, or the keen 1 property, the total of that bonus across the item can not exceed half the engineer's proficiency bonus (rounded up). For instance, an 5th-level armstech engineer who uses a modified blaster can use three attachments, instead of only one. 
- Engineer's class-specific chassis can include a number of augments up to half their proficiency bonus (rounded up), which count towards their total modifications. For instance, a 4th-level engineer, with a proficiency bonus of +2, can have only one augment in their item.
- Engineer's class-specific chassis only ever count as one attunement, regardless of the rarity of the modifications inside it.

## What It Brings
*Wretched Hives* is designed to be an *in addition to* rather than *instead of*. If you implement some—or all—of these rules, however, you create more powerful adventuring parties. The rules included here add an additional level of customization to characters. All of the rules work in conjunction with each other, but are generally not interdependent; use as much or as little as you like.

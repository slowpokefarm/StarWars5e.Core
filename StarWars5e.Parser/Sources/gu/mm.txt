<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his bestiary is for storytellers and worldbuilders. If<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you have ever thought about running a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game using my SW5e conversion for your friends, either a single night's adventure or a long-running campaign, this book contains page after page of inspiration. It's your one-stop shop for creatures both malevolent and benign.

Some of the creatures that inhabit the worlds of *Star Wars* have origins rooted in real-world mythology and fantasy literature. Other creatures are *Star Wars* originals. The monsters in this book have been culled from all multitude. Herein you'll discover classic critters such as the rancor and the dewback next to more recent creations such as the shyrack and the porg. Common beasts mingle with the weird, the terrifying, and the ridiculous. In collecting monsters from the *Star Wars* mythos, I've endeavored to reflect the multifaceted nature of the game. *Star Wars* monsters come in all shapes and sizes, with stories that not only thrill us but also make us smile.

If you're an experienced Game Master (GM) and have run traditional 5e games, nothing in this book should surprise you. For the most part, these are how I interpret the creatures of *Star Wars*, with a few of my own twists. Naturally, you can do with these monsters what you will. Nothing I say here is intended to curtail your creativity. 

## How to Use This Book
The best thing about being a GM is that you get to invent your own planet or setting and bring it to life, and nothing brings a *Star Wars* world to life more than the creatures that inhabit it. You might read a monster's entry and be spurred to create an adventure revolving around it, or you might have an awesome idea for a dungeon and need just the right monsters to populate it. That's where the *SW5e: Monster Manual* comes in handy.

The *SW5e: Monster Manual* is one of three books that form the foundation of the SW5e game, the other two being the *SW5e: Player's Handbook* and the core 5e Dungeon Master's Guide. The *SW5e: Monster Manual*, like the Dungeon Master's Guide, is a book for GMs. Use it to populate your D&D adventures with obnoxious gungans, profane aqualish, savage tuskens, mighty rancors, and a veritable horde of porgs.

Guidelines for creating encounters with monsters can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. That book also contains wandering monster tables and other goodies to help you use the monsters in this book in interesting ways, as well as advice for modifying monsters and creating your own.

## Breakdown
This book is broken down into four chapters: Beasts, Constructs, Droids, and Humanoids. Each chapter is briefly described below:

### Chapter 1: Beasts
Every planet in the galaxy has its own native creatures, and many creature have unique traits. Noteworthy creatures include the fearsome rancor, the placid dewback, the hardy tauntaun, or the obnoxious monkey-lizard.

### Chapter 2: Constructs
Constructs will encompass any kind of non-sentient machines that adventurers might encounter: turrets, vehicles, ships, etc. These often (but not always) utilize a unique mechanic called *piloted* that requires an active pilot for the construct to function.

### Chapter 3: Droids
The other side of the machine coin, droids will cover the sentient side. Droids come in five classifications, but most of the statblocks I generated will be the for combat-oriented ones.

### Chapter 4: Humanoids
The majority of the known galaxy is populated by some kind of humanoid. Most non-combat encounters, and many of the combat encounters, involve humanoids.

### Appendices
Two appendicies of all statblocks exist: one is sorted alphabetically, the other by Challenge Rating.

# Chapter 1: Beasts

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he beasts of *Star Wars* are one of the most<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; common creature types your players could encounter. Every planet has its own unique form of wildlife, offering potential roleplaying or combat opportunities. Iconic creatures such as a rancor, krayt dragon, or dewback would all fall under this category.

### Defining Features
Beasts don't have any uniform defining characteristics, per se. Generally, their combat abilities are more uniformly simple, both aggressively and defensively.

### Encounters with Beasts
Genereating encounters with beasts is usually a very simple CR calculation. Most beast types offer more than one CR option, depending on the age of the beast your players encounter.

Every planet has its own unique wildlife. While certain beasts are native to a single planet (like the rancor is native to Dathomir), others have remarkably similar cousins (like the Wampa). Additionally, some planets might have some obscure native beast that isn't replicated here. If you want to have such an encounter, either reskin a currently existing statblock appropriately or try generating your own. 

\columnbreak

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances,<br> and Condition Immunities
Beasts vary drastically based on where they come from and their own statistics. Consequently, they have no uniform damage vulnerabilities or resistances, or condition immunities.

## Acklay
Acklays are amphibious reptillian crustaceans with six deadly claws and razor-sharp teeth native to the planet Vendaxa. They are often used as execution beasts or fodder for gladiatorial arenas.

## Bantha
Banthas are a species of large, hairy mammals with sharp, spiraling horns. They are native to the desert planet Tatooine, though they are bred on many worlds throughout the galaxy. They are social herd<br> animals, and are often domesticated, and<br> used prominently, by Tusken Raiders as<br> mounts and companions.

## Dewback
Dewbacks are large, four-legged, omnivorous, cold-blooded reptiles native to the Dune Sea of Tatooine. As such, they are well-adapted to the harsh desert climate. This and the fact that they could be easily domesticated made them commonly employed as beasts of burden by both the inhabitants of the desert planet and the off-worlders wandering its dunes. Due to their numerous useful traits and versatility,<br> they are quite possibly the most<br> respected of all the creatures<br> native to Tatooine.

## Kowakian Monkey-Lizard
Kowakian monkey-lizards are a bipedal reptilian species native to a jungle-like Outer Rim planet called Kowak. Although have had no established culture, Kowakian monkey-lizards were quite intelligent, and despite their silly, cruel nature, they are considered sentient by many sentientologists in the galaxy, although there was much debate over that designation. They are often kept as pets due to their mischievous nature.

## Orbalisks
Orbalisks are parasitic creatures native to Dxun. They lay inactive in caves or other dark places, until they find a suitable host creature on whose skin they can attach themselves to in order to feed. Orbalisks, once attached to a host, rapidly multiply, eventually enveloping and suffocating their victim. However, the holocron of Freedon Nadd contains the knowledge to make armament to prevent the orbalisks from covering the face, hands, and feet of the host, allowing them to keep this armor hidden.

Perhaps by nature or as a result of residing on Dxun (which was itself a great focus of dark side power), orbalisks are able to feed on the Force-sensitivity of dark side wielders. It is said that the orbalisk armor's durability was such that lightsabers have a hard time penetrating it, making a wearer effectively immune to lightsaber attacks. The only weaknesses to this armor are the exposed joints at the neck and wrists, but these gaps are so small a lightsaber can only barely slice through. However, orbalisk armor is unable to protect the wearer from electricity. Orbalisks cause the wearer to feel pain, fueling the wearers dark side power; if they are removed or killed, they release a highly potent toxin into the host's body.

Once attached to a target, every day that passes the orbalisk will reproduce through fragmentation, so their numbers will be multiplied by 2. As the orbalisk covers the host's body, the following effects will take place (percentages relative to HP):
>
> 0-25%: Host's max HP is reduced by the number of orbalisk.
>
> 25-50%: Host's max HP is reduced by the number of orbalisk. The host gains a +2 bonus to AC, and Wisdom is decreased by 1.
>

>
> 70-90%: Host's max HP is reduced by the number of orbalisk. The host gains a +4 bonus to AC, Wisdom is decreased by 3, and max force points are reduced by two-thirds (rounded up).
>
> 90-99%: Host's max HP is reduced by the number of orbalisk. The host gains a +5 bonus to AC, Wisdom is decreased by 4, and max force points are reduced to 0.

## Porgs
Porgs are a species of non-sentient birds. They are stocky in nature, with two short wings, flat, beak-less faces, and two webbed feet. Porgs are sexually dimorphic; males are slightly larger than females, and males also have orange plumage around the eyes. Porgs of both sexes are covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. They are much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth. They can fly short distances but not far enough to leave their native island. They can also run quite swiftly on the ground and are good at maneuvering into small spaces. The birds have stereoscopic vision, colored with brown irises and black pupils. Porgs favor cold environments.

hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is 
blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the rancor, and it takes 21 (6d6) 
acid damage at the start of each of the rancor's turns.

>  If the rancor takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Rancor must succeed on a DC 20 
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space 
within 10 feet of the Rancor. If the Rancor dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape 
from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

## Shyracks
Shyracks are cave-dwelling terrors that are fiercely territorial and attack any intruder with aggression and fervor. While typically cave bound, every sixty-three years the shyracks of Korriban spill from their cave habitats for an entire summer. These periods saw them fill the sky where they blotted out the sun and moon where they rained their bluish droppings onto everything below. Prior to the return of the Sith Empire, biologists from across the galaxy arrived on the planet in order to witness every sixty-third summer where they observed the purpling of the red Korriban terrain.

While ungainly and slow-moving with no eyes, shyracks are potentially dangerous pests, especially when they converge as a swarm on an intruder. They are native to the Shyrack cave of Korriban and are natural rivals to the feared Tuk'ata.

## Ysalamir
Ysalamiri are furry, lizard-like tree-dwellers about 2 feet long native to the planet Myrkr, most known for their ability to repel the Force by creating a Force-neutral bubble. This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together can expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances – sometimes by miles.

# Chapter 2: Constructs

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/4mYR4C0.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onstructs is a broad term designed to encompass<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any potential hostile, non-sentient mechanical combat encounters. The most often encounter will be vehicles, such as speeders, tanks, and walkers, but can also appear as stationary turrets, both manned and un-manned. 

### Defining Features
One of the defining characteristics of constructs are three major features: ***Circuitry***, ***Piloted***, and ***Redirect***.

#### Circuitry
Due to their electronic nature, all constructs have the ***Circuitry*** feature:

___
> ***Circuitry.*** The construct has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.<br><br>

#### Piloted
All constructs will have the ***Piloted*** feature:

___
> ***Piloted.*** The construct requires an active pilot to take any actions, and if the pilot is subjected to any conditions that the construct is not immune to, the construct is also subjected to those conditions. The pilot may take their own action or one of the actions granted by the construct.<br><br>

You might design an encounter where the construct is controlled remotely rather than natively piloted. You'll want to consider whether this feature is necessary for you. While piloting a construct, you use the construct's statistics for its Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores, but you replace its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores with those of the pilot. While piloting a construct, the pilot can use their piloting skill to determine the construct's AC instead of the provided value (8 + Piloting skill).

#### Redirect
Most constructs will have the ***Redirect*** feature:

___
> ***Redirect.*** If the construct's pilot takes damage from a source the pilot is aware of and can see, the construct can use its reaction to instead take that damage.<br><br>

Generally, this feature is only necessary on constructs with an exposed pilot, such as STAPs, speeders, or AT-RTs. If the construct includes an enclosed canopy, such as an AT-ST or AT-AT, this feature is unnecessary. Larger constructs that still have an exposed pilot might also offer half or even three-quarters cover to the pilot in addition to this feature.

\columnbreak

### Encounters with Constructs
Generating encounters with constructs is no different than other encounters, with the exception of maintaining separate statistics for the pilot. If the pilot is reduced to 0 hit points before the construct, the construct continues on whatever trajectory it was on. If the construct is reduced to 0 hit points before the pilot, the GM can determine whether or not the pilot is able to escape with or without harm, typically utilizing a Dexterity saving throw.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances,<br> and Condition Immunities
Constructs contain their own set of damage vulnerabilities and resistances or immunities, as well condition immunities.

#### Damage Vulnerabilities
All constructs have vulnerability to ion damage. Ion damage is specifically designed to do increased damage to mechanical targets, such as constructs and droids.

#### Damage Resistances
All constructs are resistant to damage from necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Higher CR constructs might be immune to these damage types, or even resistant to unenhanced kinetic and energy damage.

#### Condition Immunities
All constructs are immune to the poison and disease conditions. If the pilot is ever subjected to a condition other than these two, the construct is also effected.

> 
> ***Troop Transport.*** The AT-AT can transport a maximum of 40 stormtroopers and five speeder bikes, which it can deploy using its Deploy Troops legendary action, or which can be fought by creatures inside of the AT-AT itself.
> 
> ***Vulnerable Interior.*** The AT-AT's interior is vulnerable to damage done by grenades, mines and charges, unless it is immune to that damage. It also automatically fails all Dexterity saving throws from such effects that occur in its interior.
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The AT-AT can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its laser cannon volley and two with its medium repeating blasters.
>
> ***Laser Cannon Volley.*** The AT-AT chooses a point within 320 ft and lets loose a blast from each of its heavy laser cannons that explodes in a 15ft cube around that point. Each creature within the cube must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

>
>***Frightful Presence:*** Each creature of the AT-AT's choice that is within 240 feet of the AT-AT and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the AT-AT's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
> ### Legendary Actions
> The AT-AT can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The AT-AT regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.
>
> **Stomp** The AT-AT makes a stomp attack.
>
> **Repeating Blasters** The AT-AT makes a single attack with its medium repeating blasters.
>
> **Deploy Troops (Costs 2 Actions).** The AT-AT mobilizes some of the soldiers traveling within it. It deploys 1d4+2 Troopers and 1 74-Z speeder bike. These troops appear in any unoccupied spaces within 10 ft. of the AT-AT.

## Single Trooper<br> Aerial Platform
The Single Trooper Aerial Platform (or STAP) is a Baktoid Armor Workshop product inspired by civilian airhooks. They re-engineered similar craft for greater performance and reliability. Slim and lightweight, the tiny repulsorlift craft is fueled by high-voltage energy cells, which power drive turbines providing the STAP with impressive speed and maneuverability. The agile vessels are popular mounts for droids, and are typically bolstered by signals from an orbital Droid Control Ship, which skillfully guides the STAP's pilots. However, battle droids are exposed to enemy fire while riding the fragile craft. The vehicles are armed with a pair of forward-mounted blaster cannons.<br><br><br><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roids are sentient mechanical units, most often<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; designed with humanoid appearances. Droids serve a myriad of functions; they are teachers and cleaners, soldiers and mechanics. Due to their man-made nature, droids are often considered expendable (though some develop emotional attachments to their droids) and thus are commonly used in place of or in addition to soldiers and guardsmen.

### Defining Features
Like their construct counterpats, droids share the ***Circuitry*** feature. Droids also vary drastically based on their classification. Of the five classes of droids, class four droids are optimized for combat, and thus are the most suited to combat encounters.

#### Circuitry
Due to their electronic nature, all droids have the ***Circuitry*** feature:

___
> ***Circuitry.*** The droid has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.<br><br>

### Encounters with Droids
Generating encounters with droids requires little consideration beyond taking into account your party composition and then vulnerabilities and resistances of droids. Droids come in different model lines, and some lines offer multiple models of different CRs for you to choose from.

There are numerous droid manufacturers, and while they might make different model lines of droids, many are functionally identical. If the statblock for your preferred droid doesn't exist, try repurposing one that does.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances,<br> and Condition Immunities
Similar to constructs, droids have their own set of damage vulnerabilities and resistances.

#### Damage Vulnerabilities
All droids have vulnerability to ion damage. Ion damage is specifically designed to do increased damage to mechanical targets, such as constructs and droids.

#### Damage Resistances
All droids are resistant to damage from necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Higher CR droids might be immune to these damage types, or even resistant to unenhanced kinetic and energy damage.

#### Condition Immunities
All droids are immune to the poison and disease conditions.

## Destroyer Droid
The destroyer droid is a type of heavy battle droid originally crafted by colicoids. It has a reputation for deadliness due to its resilience and firepower, as well as the fear it can instill in even the most powerful Jedi. They are also used for executions. Destroyer droids are equipped with<br> dual built-in blaster cannons and a built-in<br> deflector shield generator. Due to their<br> ponderous nature, destroyer droids have<br> a ball-form that they can transform<br> into, granting them great speed.

## HK Series Assassin Droid
The HK series assassin droid, also known as the HK series protocol droid, is a combination of an assassin droid and protocol droid. The series designation stands for "Hunter Killer," befitting their primary functions as assassins. They are manufactured by Czerka Corporation. Their ability to perform the functions of a protocol droid became a major reason for their unmatched lethality, as they could and would often act as normal (if quite sinister looking) protocol droids, thus concealing their true function and allowing them to get<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; closer to intended targets. HK series assassin<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; droids are equipped with an integrated emergency<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shield and jet pack.

# Chapter 4: Humanoids

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s the most populace creature type your players<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will encounter, humanoids are the most diverse creature type. They are the soldiers and scouts, the engineers and operatives, the Jedi and the Sith. Humanoids are probably the most common creature your players will encounter as they adventure throughout the galaxy.

### Defining Features
Humanoids run the gamut. You'll encounter simple chefs, stalwart soldiers, and malicious Sith lords.

### Encounters with Humanoids
Generating encounters with humanoids is generally pretty straight forward. Humanoids are generally smarter than class four droids and beasts, so they will often act more strategically. Soldiers will hide behind cover and scouts will attack from high vantages while hidden. Operatives will attempt to hide behind enemy lines in order to surprise.

When you generate a humanoid encounter, take into consideration the surroundings. There should be opportunities for both players and NPCs to find cover from a hail of blaster bolts. 

\columnbreak

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances,<br> and Condition Immunities
Humanoids have no inherent vulnerabilities or resistances, except those based on their species.

## Rakghouls
Rakghouls are a living plague–the manifestation of a highly communicable disease capable of swiftly transforming its victims into twisted, degenerate monsters with predatory instincts. The rakghoul virus can infect hundreds of known species and is most often delivered through a rakghoul's bite; a person attacked by a rakghoul and “lucky” enough to survive typically becomes a rakghoul him- or herself. Some victims resist the virus for days, succumbing to rakghoul instincts while retaining their original bodies.

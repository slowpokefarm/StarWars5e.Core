## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

### Companion Keeper
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
You gain the services of a companion. Choose one of the companion nature options, detailed later in this chapter.

### Close Quarters Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced utilizing powers in close quarters, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- When making a ranged force or tech attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.  
- Your ranged force and tech attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. 
- You learn one at-will power that requires an attack roll. Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.

### Combat Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced making your powers more difficult to avoid, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- When a creature rolls a 1 on the d20 roll of a saving throw against a power you cast that deals damage, they instead take the highest number possible for the damage die.
- You learn one at-will power that requires a saving throw. Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.

### Dual Focused Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You have learned to bifurcate your attention while concentrating on powers, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- If you attempt to cast a power that requires concentration while already concentrating on an existing power, you can maintain concentration on both powers simultaneously. You must spend your action each subsequent round on maintaining this concentration, or lose concentration for both powers.                              
- At the end of each of your turns where you have two powers you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of complete rounds you've been concentrating on two powers). On a failure, you lose concentration for both powers. You can drop concentration on one of your powers during your turn as a free action to avoid this saving throw.
- Any time you would be forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both powers' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a failure, you lose concentration on both powers.

### Martial Adept
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- If you already have superiority dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have two superiority dice, which are d4s. These dice are used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

### Mounted Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You are trained in the use of powers while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:
- When you cast a power targeting yourself, you can also affect your mount with the power.
- You have advantage on melee force or tech attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Quick Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced casting powers in quick succession, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- When you cast a power with a casting time of a bonus action, you may use your action to cast a power with a power level no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded down).
- When you cast a power with a casting time of a bonus action, you can cast it without expending force or tech points as long as it is no higher level than your proficiency bonus. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Sniping Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced casting powers more accurately from long range, learning techniques that give you the following benefits:

- Your ranged force and tech attacks ignore one-quarter, half, and three-quarters cover.
- You learn one at-will power that requires an attack roll. Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.

### War Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced casting powers in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a power when you take damage.
- Once per round, when a hostile creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a power at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The power must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.

### Casting Specialist
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You've mastered your chosen casting type, gaining the following benefits:
- You gain a +1 bonus to your force or tech save DC and your force or tech attack modifier.
- Once per turn, when you cast a power that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can have advantage on one attack roll, or you can force one creature affected by the power to have advantage or disadvantage on the saving throw (your choice). Once you've used this feature on a power, you can't affect that power again until you complete a short or long rest. Once you've used this feature on a creature, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
- Once per turn, when you cast a power that doesn't require an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, but requires a die roll, you can choose the maximum or minimum on the die (your choice). If the power requires rolling multiple dice, you can only affect a number of them equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) in this way. Once you've used this feature on a power, you can't affect that power again until you complete a short or long rest.

You can select this feat twice. Each time you do so, you must choose a different casting type.

## Lightsaber Forms
Certain class features, Formfighting Style, or Formfighting Mastery, offer your choice of lightsaber forms. You can't take a lightsaber form option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

In addition to the forms presented in the Player's Handbook, you may choose your lightsaber forms from the following options or roll on the table below to determine them randomly.

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d12|Lightsaber Form|
|:--:|:--|
|1|Ataru|
|2|Jar'Kai|
|3|Juyo/Vapaad|
|4|Makashi|
|5|Niman|
|6|Shien/Djem So|

|d12|Lightsaber Form|
|:--:|:--|
|7|Shii-Cho|
|8|Soresu|
|9|Sokan|
|10|Trakata|
|11|Vonil/Ishu|
|12|Ysannanite|

</div>

Each known form can be adopted on your turn by using your bonus action.

#### Vonil/Ishu Form
If you took the Attack action before adopting this form, you can direct one of your companions to strike a creature you hit with an attack. Choose a friendly creature within 5 feet of the creature you hit with an attack that can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack against the same creature you hit with an attack.

If you did not take the Attack action before adopting this form, and there is a friendly creature within 15 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet. You must end this movement within 5 feet of the friendly creature.

#### Ysannanite Form
As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. 

Additionally, until the end of your next turn, when making a ranged weapon attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. 

\pagebreak

## Companions
A companion is a creature who accompanies you on your adventures. It might take the form of a fearsome beast, a padawan learner, a droid sidekick, or a mischievous spirit. Some companions are an integral part of an archetype, while others are simple NPCs that characters encounter and adopt during their adventures.

> #### Companions In Your Game
> Companions are not for the faint of heart. They add a significant power boost to a party, and can really bog down your game if their player's are not prepared. You might choose to allow your players to use the companion archetypes, but not the feats, vice versa, both options, or none. It's up to you.
>
> ***Downtime Activities.*** Companions should not be able to perform downtime activities separately from their player's character. However, companions should be able to help others perform their downtime activities. Additionally, a player can choose to have their companion perform a downtime activity, though their character must spend their downtime helping the companion.
>
> ***Encounter Building and Experience Allocation.*** A companion's level matches that of their owner, so they do not need to gain experience. However, you should consider treating a companion as half a character when building encounters and distributing experience. For instance, if your party is three characters and one companion, you should generate encounters and divide experience gained 3.5 ways, instead of simply three ways.
>
> ***Enhanced Items.*** Companions should not count towards party size when allocating enhanced items. Additionally, while companion classes share names with their player character class counterparts, companions can not attune to items that require that class.
>
> ***Starships and Deployments.*** Companions can not deploy as pilots, though they can fill other deployments as normal. Additionally, companions can gain deployment ranks, though they accrue prestige at half the rate of player characters, and they can not exceed 4 ranks in a deployment.

### Gaining a Companion
Certain archetypes, such as the Astrotech Engineer, Saboteur Operative, or Zoologist Scholar, have their companions as the focus of their archetype's features. Alternatively, a companion can be gained through taking the Companion Keeper feat, detailed later in this chapter.

Regardless of how a companion is obtained, each player may have no more than one companion at a given time.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Generating Your Companion
First, you should determine your companion's nature and appearance, as determined by your archetype feature or chosen from the list of companion natures if you take the Companion Keeper feat. Second, allocate your companion's ability scores, as determined by its nature. Finally, you should generate your companion from 1st level using the follower class, and increase its level one level at a time, until its level equals your own. Be sure to update your companion's hit points, ability scores, proficiency bonus, and any features it gains as it levels.

#### Class and Features
Your companion gains features when it reaches certain levels, as shown in the follower table.

#### Companion Nature
Your companion's nature, discussed later in this chapter, is determined by your archetype feature or companion feat. Your companion's nature determines its type, its hit points and Hit Dice, its proficiencies and other features, and its companion traits. At 1st level, your companion starts with two traits. It gains additional traits when it reaches higher levels, as shown in the follower table.

#### Leveling Your Companion
Your companion's level equals your own, and each time you gain a level, so does your companion. 

#### Proficiency Bonus
Your companion's proficiency bonus is equal to that of a player character of the same level, as shown in the follower table.

### Companions in Combat
In combat, companions generally behave as a player character would, with the following differences.

#### Actions in Combat
Unless you use your bonus action to direct your companion, your companion can only use its action to Dash, Dodge, Disengage, Guard, or Hide.

#### Companion Initiative
Both you and your companion roll initiative, but you act together on the lesser of the two results. You act on one turn, and you can each move or take actions in any order.

## Companion Natures
Certain class features grant a specific companion nature, while the Companion Keeper feat offers your choice of companion nature. You must meet a companion nature's requirement in order to choose that companion. You may only have one active companion at a time.

> #### Alternative Companions
> Your archetype feature may grant you one type of companion, whereas your character can be better realized utilizing a different companion. For instance, an astrotech engineer might prefer to have a tracker droid over one of the larger droid options. Work with your GM to determine if a different companion is better suited, and mechanically appropriate, to your character's identity. 

&emsp;You may choose your companion's nature from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly. 

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d10|Companion Nature|
|:--:|:--|
|1|Aberrant|
|2|Beast|
|3|Droid|
|4|Humanoid|
|5|Spirit|

|d10|Companion Nature|
|:--:|:--|
|6|Thrall|
|7|Tracker Droid|
|8|Turret|
|9|Vehicle|
|10||

</div>

If you determine your companion's nature randomly, and the result is a nature for which you are ineligible, simply reroll until you get a proper result.

If your companion is irreparably destroyed, or you want a different companion, you must first break the bond with your current companion. Bonding with a new companion takes 8 hours spent in an appropriate location. You may only have one companion at a time. If you want to change your companion nature, as with the Alternative Companions feature above.

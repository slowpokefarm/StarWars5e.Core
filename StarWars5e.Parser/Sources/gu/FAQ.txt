### How do attack rolls work?
Attacks have a total of three words that define how they function: for instance, **melee weapon attack**. Each word affects the rules for that attack.

#### 1. The first word is always **melee** or **ranged**. 
- A **melee** attack can only made while within 5 feet of the target (unless a feature says otherwise, like the *reach* weapon property).
- A **ranged** attack can only be made against targets within a specified range, included in the weapon or power's description. Additionally, when a hostile target is within 5 feet of you while making a **ranged** attack, you have disadvantage on the attack roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like the Close Quarters Shooting fighting style).
-- Occasionally, neither **melee** or **ranged** will be present in a feature about attacks. That means that feature applies to both **melee** and **ranged** attack rolls.

#### 2. The second word is always **weapon**, **force**, **tech**, or **ship** (if you use the Starships expansion).
- A **weapon** attack allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll if they are proficient. You always add your Strength modifier to **melee** weapon attacks and your Dexterity modifier to **ranged** weapon attacks (unless a feature says otherwise, like the *finesse* weapon property). You __always__ add your modifier to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like Two-Weapon Fighting). (PHB 184)
- A **force** attack always allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll; if you have the forcecasting feature, you are proficient in all forcecasting attacks. You always add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to force attacks, depending on the power's alignment. (PHB 190) You __never__ add your modifier to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like Potent Lightning). (PHB 43).
- A **tech** attack always allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll; if you have the techcasting feature, you are proficient in all techcasting attacks. You always add your Intelligence modifier to tech attacks. You __never__ add your modifier to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like Adaptable Applications). (Expanded Content - Archetypes - Cybertech Engineering).
- A **ship** attack allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll if they are proficient. You always add the ship's Dexterity modifier to ship attacks (unless a feature says otherwise, like the Calculating Gunner venture). You __always__ add the ship's Dexterity to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like the Calculating Gunner venture). (SotG 66)

#### 3. The third word is always **attack**. 
An attack roll always involves rolling a d20, adding the relevant modifiers, and comparing to the target’s AC. If the total meets or exceeds the target’s AC, the attack is considered a hit.

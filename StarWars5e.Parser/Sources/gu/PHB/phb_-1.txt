### The Player's Handbook
The Player's Handbook mirrors the traditional 5th edition Player's Handbook, with the following deviations.

#### Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Characters
This chapter explains step-by-step character building, as exemplified by Han Solo.

#### Chapter 2: Species
Races relabeled to species, all of which are brand new.

#### Chapter 3: Classes
There are ten classes. All ten classes receive their archetype at 3rd level, instead of it varying by class. Additionally, all classes have a second level of customization beyond archetype, similar to how Warlocks get Invocations in 5e. Lastly, all class capstones now offer a total of +4 to ability scores, including thir maximums. 
- **Berserker:** This is an adaptation of the barbarian class, with the additional customization layer of Berserker Instincts. Berserker capstone ability scores reduced, but they gain an additional feature.
- **Consular:** The full caster for the Force side of casting, this class consolidates features of cleric, sorcerer, and wizard. It has Force-Empowered Casting as its second layer of customization, which is derived from sorcerer's Metamagic.
- **Engineer:** The engineer is a full caster for the tech side of casting, extrapolating from artificer with some bard elements sprinkled in. The additional layer of customization for engineers is driven from its archetypes.
- **Fighter:** Similar to it's 5e counterpart, with two major changes: maneuvers are now a baseline feature as the fighter's second level of customization, and fighters now gain a Fighting Mastery at 3rd level.
- **Guardian:** Mostly derived from paladin, guardians are the half caster for the Force. Their second level of customization is their auras.
- **Monk:** Monks are naturally inspired by their 5e counterpart, but with a significant number of changes and buffs. They gain a second level of customization in their Monastic Vows.
- **Operative:** This version of the rogue has operative exploits as their second level of customization. Additionally, most archetypes grant alternative ways to use Sneak Attack.
- **Scholar:** This brand new class has two levels of customization beyond archetypes: maneuvers (similar to that of the fighter class) and discoveries.
- **Scout:** This is the half caster for the tech side of casting, naturally inspired by the ranger, with baseline hunter's mark and a second level of customization called Scout Routines.
- **Sentinel:** This Force caster utilizes a new "two-thirds" casting progression, falling between guardian and consular. It utilizes some bard features, and has an additional layer of customization called Sentinel Ideals.

#### Chapter 4: Backgrounds
Backgrounds feature one major difference; each background also offers a choice of feat. This helps players realize their characters in a more personal fashion.

#### Chapter 5: Equipment
Currency has been changed to credits, with roughly 1 gp = 10 cr. Magic items are reskinned as enhanced items, with rarities designed to mimic those of **Star Wars: the Old Republic**. Equipment functions similarly, with the exception of the breakdown of weapons; rather than just simple and martial, they are broken down into blasters, lightsabers, and vibroweapons. This also includes three tiers of shields: light, medium, and heavy, with proficiencies collapsed into the appropriate armor. There is a significant number of new weapon properties as well, and most items are new otherwise.

#### Chapter 6: Customization Options
- New multiclassing requirements/proficiencies
- Spell point variant with different multiclassing
- Fighting styles have been completely changed, with paired fighting masteries
- Lots more feats

#### Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores
Generally the same, with the exception of skills; Arcana, History, and Religion have been collapsed into Lore, with Piloting and Technology being new skills. Expertise is now a defined keyword alonside proficiency.

#### Chapter 8: Adventuring
Minor changes to better fit the galaxy at large.

#### Chapter 9: Combat
Lots of changes here. This chapter will want to be read start to finish, despite it being similar to traditional 5e.
- Object Interaction is now more specifically defined and utilized.
- New action: Guard.
- Shoving split in to two separate keywords so they can be cited independently.
- Double-Weapon Fighting is a new mechanic for weapons with two ends for fighting.
- Two-Weapon Fighting now works with blasters.
- Three layers of partial cover, instead of only two, with adjusted values.
- Critical Hit Range a defined attribute.
- Damage types have been changed.
- Rules for temporary force and tech points, which function similar to temporary hit points.

#### Chapter 10:<br> Force- and Tech-casting
There are several changes in this section:
- Spells are now called powers.
- Cantrips are now called at-will powers.
- There are no more class lists. Instead, your force- or tech-casting feature gives you access to the full force or tech powers list.
- A simplification of the spell point variant from the DMG. Basically, casting a power at a given level costs that level + 1 points.
- Spellcasting has been separated into force- and tech-casting.<br> &emsp;Forcecasting uses Wisdom/Charisma and Force Points, which regenerate on a long rest.<br> &emsp;Techcasting uses Intelligence and Tech Points, which regenerate on a short or long rest.<br> &emsp;While a character can have both force- and tech-casting, they are kept completely separate.
- The number of known at-will powers and 1st-level and higher powers are no longer separate. 

#### Chapters 11 and 12: Force and Tech Powers
Chapter 11 has been broken down into two chapters to keep force and tech powers separate.

#### Appendix A: Conditions
This appendix features most (all?) of the traditional 5e conditions, as well as a couple new ones.

#### Appendix B: Recommended Variant Rules
This appendix features a number of highlighted variant rules.

#### Index
It's an index.

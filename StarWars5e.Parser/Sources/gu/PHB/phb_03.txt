<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">dventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against. 

Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the galaxy. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A consular, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant of the Force. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the consular might know a number of Jedi or Sith who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and an engineer's powers. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.

\columnbreak

&emsp;Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. An operative might switch direction in life and become an engineer. A berserker might discover latent force sensitivity and dabble in the guardian class while continuing to advance as a berserker. Sith purebloods are known to combine martial mastery with force training and advance as fighters and consulars simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.

> Many classes and archetypes add material costs to obtain features integral to the class while most others don't. Your GM can choose to waive the time and cost component if they choose to do so.
>
> Additionally, certain classes and subclasses will often find themselves with a singular force or tech point, with which they can do nothing. Any character with the force- or tech-casting feature also gains the following feature:
> 
> When you fail an ability check, if you added your proficiency bonus to the check and you did not have advantage or disadvantage, you can spend 1 force or tech point to reroll the die. You can only use this feature once per ability check, and you must use the new roll.

Choose from the following class options:

## Berserker
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A massive wookiee hunter prowls through the forest, hefting</span> his vibroaxe. With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin. 

A gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. 

Frothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.

These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.
  
<div style='margin-top:34px'></div>

### Primal Instinct
People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of<br> superiority. To a berserker, though,<br> civilization is no virtue, but a sign<br> of weakness. The strong embrace their<br> animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.

Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.
  
<div style='margin-top:105px'></div>

### A Life of Danger
Not every person deemed "berserkers" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.

### Creating a Berserker
When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

#### Quick Build
You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the mercenary background.

### Rage
_**Berserker:** 1st level_<br>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if you aren't wearing heavy armor.

While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the berserker table.
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't taken a hostile action or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

You can enter a rage a number of times as shown for your berserker level in the Rages column of the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Unarmored Defense
_**Berserker:** 1st level_<br>
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Reckless Attack 
_**Berserker:** 2nd level_<br>
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Berserker Instincts
_**Berserker:** 2nd level_<br>
You've honed two instincts, as detailed at the end of the class description. You hone an additional instinct at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Danger Sense
_**Berserker:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Berserker Approach
_**Berserker:** 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level_<br>
You choose an approach that shapes the nature of your rage which is detailed at the end of the class description. 

\columnbreak

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Berserker:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
_**Berserker:** 5th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Feral Impulse
_**Berserker:** 7th level_<br>
Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical
_**Berserker:** 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. 

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage
_**Berserker:** 11th level_<br>
Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage
_**Berserker:** 15th level_<br>
Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might
_**Berserker:** 18th level_<br>
If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion
_**Berserker:** 20th level_<br>
You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.

Additionally, you can enter rage an unlimited number of times, and entering rage no longer requires your bonus action on your turn.

#### Hawk's Instinct
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty. You are able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.

#### Varactyl's Instinct
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
While raging, you have advantage Dexterity checks, your attack rolls can't suffer from disadvantage, and each slowed level only reduces your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0.

## Berserker Approaches
For berserkers, rage is an internal<br> reservoir where pain, grief, and<br> anger are forged into a fury hard<br> as steel. Your approach grants you<br> features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th<br> level.

## Ballistic Approach
For many, rushing an opponent with guns blazing is a last resort. For Berserkers of the Ballistic Approach, this isn't a last resort; it's the primary plan. Leading with a blaster and pure, unbridled rage, the berserker never lets an empty gun diminish their fury.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Firestorm
_**Ballstic Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in martial blasters with the burst or rapid property. Additionally, you've learned to use ranged weapons with untold fury. While wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When making a ranged weapon attack while within 30 feet of your target, you use your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- When you use a blaster as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient with it.

### Explosive
_**Ballstic Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack made with a blaster weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
- You add your rage damage to damage rolls from ranged weapon attacks using Strength. You may only apply your rage damage to one target when you use the burst property.

### Rampage
_**Ballstic Approach:** 9th level_<br>
While raging, when you deal damage with a blaster with which you are proficient, and you added your Strength modifier to the damage roll, you can use a bonus action to move up to half your speed towards your target. You must end this movement closer to your target than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of your target, you can make one melee weapon attack with your blaster as a part of this bonus action.

Additionally, when a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against your burst or rapid property, you can apply your Brutal Critical dice to the roll against that creature.

### Down, Not Out
_**Ballstic Approach:** 10th level_<br>
When you are hit with anattack by a creature within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against that creature with a blaster with which you are proficient.

### Brawn
_**Ballstic Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you use the burst property of a blaster with which are you proficient, you can apply your rage damage bonus to every target that takes damage, instead of just one. Additionally, when a creature fails the saving throw against your burst or rapid property, it is knockedprone.

## Marauder Approach
Few things are more terrifying than being in the path of a Berserker who has learned the ways of the Force. Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it's clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.

### Forcecasting
_**Marauder Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the<br> alignment of the powers you cast. You use<br> Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma<br> for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

</div>

___

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Furious Force
_**Marauder Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast that require a force attack or saving throw. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. 

Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires a force attack.

### Reckless Power
_**Marauder Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Weapons and the force are equally an extension of your rage. While you are raging and you use your action to cast a force power, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Powerful Presence
_**Marauder Approach:** 10th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with force energy. Choose up to ten other creatures of within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Friendly creatures have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn, and hostile creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Force Storm
_**Marauder Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You can expel the might of your rage all at once to unleash a devastating storm of force energy. As an action, you can end your rage early, forcing each creature within 15 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d12 force damage for each round you've spent in rage, or half as much on a successful one.

## Precision Approach
Some berserkers have learned to channel their rage into a method of increasing their focus and precision to supernatural levels. Those berserkers who choose the Precision Approach hone their rage to a fine point, becoming agile warriors who ruthlessly dispatch their foes.

### Careful Steps
_**Precision Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain skills that represent your precise movement. You gain proficiency your choice of Acrobatics or Stealth. While raging, you have advantage on checks you make with the chosen skill.

### Focused Rage
_**Precision Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You hone your rage to a razor sharp focus. While raging, when you make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity, you add your rage damage to the damage roll. Additionally, you can use your Reckless Attack feature to give you advantage on melee weapon attacks using Dexterity during your turn.

### Battle Anticipation
_**Precision Approach:** 6th level_<br>
While raging, your critical hit range with melee weapon attacks using Dexterity increases by 1.

### Improved Danger Sense
_**Precision Approach:** 10th level_<br>
While raging, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers, you are treated as proficient in the save, and you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Calm Within the Storm
_**Precision Approach:** 14th level_<br>
The precision with which you act during your rage causes you to become a storm of reactive lethality. When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can make a number of opportunity attacks equal to your proficiency bonus without using your reaction, and when a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity against that creature. You can only take one reaction per turn.

## Warchief Approach
For some berserkers, it is their duty or birthright to lead their tribe and kin to battle and victory. The Warchief Approach is one forged from alliances, bonds, and strategy. In combat, your rages are less mindless, and more focused. Ignoring the distractions of unimportant events, your attention hones in on the battlefield and how best to direct and control it. You guide your allies' strikes, and your presence is enough to wash away their fatigue.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Savage Diplomat
_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Your path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.

### Commanding Rage
_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You become more aware of your allies, and their intent when fighting at your side. While you are raging, when an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an enemy, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack and add your rage damage bonus to the damage roll, if the attack hits.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Inspiring Presence
_**Warchief Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your mere presence on the battlefield rallies your allies. When you rage, choose up to 3 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

### Raid Planning
_**Warchief Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to their next initiative roll, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.

### War Chant
_**Warchief Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage on your turn, you can enter a commanding rage for one minute. When you do so, during this turn and at the start of each of your turns, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus you can only use for your Commanding Rage feature. When you use Commanding Rage with these special reactions, they do not count against your uses of that feature. You can only use one reaction per turn. Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

## Consular
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A twi'lek in black robes steps on a terrified rodian, who </span> scampers away on the ground. Lightning sparks from his fingers, illuminating his red and black tattoos. The rodian's pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears as the Sith channels his lightning into his failed apprentice, leaving nothing but a charred husk behind.

Sitting cross-legged on a dense patch of grass, a miraluka mystic meditates on the Force. With every breath, the trees sway with a rhythmic breeze. Though she lacks simple vision, she can see the Force as it moves everything around her. 

A drably-robed human focuses inward, channeling the Force into the ground around him. Slowly, all the debris within arms reach rises into the air around him; with a flick of his wrist, he clears the air, sending his projectiles to pound on the approaching tank.

Consulars are the supreme wielders of the Force, defined and united by the powers they cast. Drawing on the omnipresent Force that permeates the universe, consulars cast powers of rejuvenating healing and destructive lightning, draining life-force and manipulating minds; the most powerful with the Force can even experience brief glimpses of the future. 

<div style='margin-top:175px'></div>

### Strong with the Force
Refraining from drawing their lightsabers except as a measure of last resort, consulars spend a great deal of time studying the mysteries of the Force. Their knowledge allows them to channel the Force to greater heights, unlocking unrivaled power, and twisting those powers to greater effect. 

<div style='margin-top:175px'></div>

### Sage or Sorcerer
Consulars who follow the light side of the Force, using their powers to better their communities and people, are often called sages, while consulars who fall to the dark side and subjugate or cast aside all in their path are commonly called sorcerers. Alternatively, they may tend toward the middle, refraining from politics and war, spending their time in isolation and study.

### Creating a Consular
While creating your consular, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners ï¿½ the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Perhaps you were ostracized from your primitive village out of superstition or jealousy. You may have been brutally trained from a young age in the dark side, fueling your innate thirst for power, or perhaps you were trained as a padawan in one of the Jedi temples. How do you treat strangers, and how do they treat you once they know your abilities? What was your family like, or what did you have instead of a family? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray? 

#### Quick Build
You can make a consular quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom or Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

\pagebreakNum

### Forcecasting
_**Consular:** 1st level_<br>
In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 9 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular table.

You may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

</div>

___

### Force Recovery
_**Consular:** 1st level_<br>
You have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of force points equal to half your consular level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Force-Empowered Casting
_**Consular:** 2nd, 9th, and 17th level_<br>
You gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional force points to modify the power. You gain two of the following Force-Empowered Casting options of your choice. You gain another one at 9th and 17th level.

You can use only one Force-Empowered Casting option on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

#### Careful Power
When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power's full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.

#### Distant Power
When you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional force point to double the range of the power.

Alternatively, when you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional force point to make the range of the power 30 feet.

#### Extended Power
When you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional force point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Heightened Power
When you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 additional force points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.

#### Improved Power
When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.

#### Lingering Power
When you cast a power that requires concentration to maintain you can choose to spend 3 additional force points. If you do, when you lose concentration on the power, the power will not end until the end of your next turn.

#### Pinpoint Power 
When you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | CONSULAR</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Quickened Power
When you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

#### Refocused Power 
When you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power you can use your reaction and spend 2 force points to automatically succeed on the saving throw.

You can use Refocused Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.

#### Seeking Power
If you miss with a force power that calls for an attack roll, you can spend 2 force points to reroll the attack. You must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.

#### Twinned Power
When you cast a power that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of additional force points equal to the power's level to target a second creature in range with the same power (1 force point if the power is at-will).

### Force Shield
_**Consular:** 2nd level_<br>
You learn how to defend yourself purely through your strength with the Force. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in Force energy. Until the start of your next turn, you have a bonus to AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1). This includes the triggering attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Force Affinity
_**Consular:** 3rd level_<br>
You've developed an affinity for one of the three aspects of the Force: the Ashla, the Bendu, or the Bogan. Choose one from the following:

#### Ashla
When you successfully cast a light side power, either your or the target's (your choice) hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to the power's level. This effect lasts for 1 minute. You can only have one instance of this effect active at a time.

#### Bendu
You can add both your Wisdom and Charisma modifier to your maximum number of force points, instead of just one.

#### Bogan
When you roll a 1 on a damage die for a dark side power, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1. 

### Consular Tradition
_**Consular:** 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level_<br>
You choose a consular tradition, which is detailed at the end of the class description. 

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Consular:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### One with the Force
_**Consular:** 20th level_<br>
Your attunement to the Force is absolute. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score increases by 4. Additionally, you gain mastery over a single force power, and can cast it with little effort. Choose one 3rd-level force power that you know as your signature power. You can cast it once at 3rd level without expending force points. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast it at a higher level, you must expend force points as normal.

## Consular Traditions
Different consulars select different traditions, called Ways, to follow as they hone their powers. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

## Way of Balance
There is serenity in balance, and no one knows this better than the consular. Those consulars who follow the Way of Balance focus on utilizing the Force to equalize the battlefield. They bend the Force to shield their allies and expose their foes.

### Force Barrier
_**Way of Balance:** 3rd level_<br>
You can weave the Force around yourself for protection. When you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously manipulate the Force to create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your consular level +<br> your Wisdom or Charisma modifier<br> (your choice).

Whenever you take damage, the barrier<br> takes the damage instead. If this damage<br> reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take<br> any remaining damage.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't<br> absorb damage, but its power remains.<br> Whenever you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the power.

Once you create the barrier, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Barrier
_**Way of Balance:** 6th level_<br>
When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Force Barrier to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### At-Will Barrier
_**Way of Balance:** 10th level_<br>
Your at-will universal powers grant a small boost to your Force Barrier. When you cast an at-will universal power, the barrier regains 1 hit point. You can't restore your barrier above half its maximum hit points in this way.

### Improved Suppression
_**Way of Balance:** 1st level_<br>
At 14th level, when you cast a force power that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that power, such as *sever force* or *force suppression*, you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Force Resistance
_**Way of Balance:** 1st level_<br>
Starting at 18th level, you have advantage on saving throws against force powers. Additionally, you have resistance against the damage of force powers.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/KuUWgUr.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-100px;right:-380px;width:1063px;transform:scaleX(-1);z-index:1000;' />

## Way of Lightning
Of all of the dark arts of the Force, little can match the spectacle and devastation of Force lightning. Those consulars who follow the Way of Lightning summon intense discharges of pure Force energy, overwhelming enemies with punishing damage from a distance, leaving them shaken and vulnerable -- if not dead.

### Shocking Affinity
_**Way of Lightning:** 3rd level_<br>
When you cast a force power that deals lightning damage, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it.

Additionally, when you cast a damage-dealing force power that requires a force attack or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal lightning damage. If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. If you hit with the power, or the target fails the power's saving throw, affected creatures become *shocked* until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Potent Lightning
_**Way of Lightning:** 6th level_<br>
You add your governing ability modifier (minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with force powers that deal lightning damage that don't already include that modifier.

### Blistering Rebuke
_**Way of Lightning:** 10th level_<br>
When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 plus your consular level lightning damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and becomes *shocked* until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved or *shocked*.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Electric Attunement
_**Way of Lightning:** 14th level_<br>
You gain resistance to lightning damage, and force powers you cast ignore resistance to lightning damage.

### Unlimited Power
_**Way of Lightning:** 18th level_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;You can increase the power of your simpler<br> &emsp;&emsp;lightning force powers. When you cast a<br> &emsp;&emsp;force power of 1st through 6th level that deals<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;lightning damage, you can deal maximum<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;damage with that power.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You can use this feature with no adverse<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;effects a number of times equal to<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a minimum of once). If you use this feature<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;beyond this before you finish a long rest,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you take 2d12 necrotic damage for<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;each level of the power, immediately after<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you cast it.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | CONSULAR</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Way of the Sage
The rejuvenating power of the Force is incredible, and the consular is the master of this usage. Those consulars who follow the Way of the Sage assist with an array of healing powers that grant allies the strength to continue through even the harshest of encounters. Separated from the heart of the fray, the sage can be an unfailing warden to those in need.

### Disciple of Life
_**Way of the Sage:** 3rd level_<br>
When you cast a force power that restores hit points, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it. 

Additionally, whenever you use a force power of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains extra hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.

### Preserve Life
_**Way of the Sage:** 6th level_<br>
As an action, you can channel the Force and evoke healing energy that restores a number of hit points equal to five times your consular level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its hit point maximum. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

You can use this feature a<br> number of times equal to your<br> Wisdom or Charisma modifier<br> (your choice, a minimum of<br> once). You regain all<br> expended uses when you<br> finish a long rest.

### Blessed Healer
_**Way of the Sage:** 10th level_<br>
The healing powers you cast on others<br> heal you as well. When you cast a force<br> power that restores hit points to a<br> creature other than you, you regain hit<br> points equal to 2 + the power's level.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Blessed by the Force
_**Way of the Sage:** 14th level_<br>
You gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Supreme Healing
_**Way of the Sage:** 18th level_<br>
When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a power, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For instance, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

## Way of Suggestion
There is power in a light touch, and no one knows this better than the consular. Those consulars who follow the Way of Suggestion have honed their attunement to the Force, allowing them to disappear, despite being in plain sight.

### Subtle Control
_**Way of Suggestion:** 3rd level_<br>
You can befuddle a creature's mind with nothing but a gesture. As an action, you can cause a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, you can force the creature to believe or forget a single aspect of a conversation, observation or encounter it had that you were present for in the past 10 minutes. Whether the creature succeeds or fails their saving throw, you can't use this feature on them again until you finish a long rest. 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Additionally, creatures who attempt to<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;detect your use of the Force have<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;disadvantage on ability checks to do so,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if a creature has the *sense force* or<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;*force sight* power active, they must<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;succeed on a universal forcecasting<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ability check against your universal force<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;save DC in order to notice your usage of<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Force, your alignment within the<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Force, or how strong your connection<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;to the Force is. 

### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Out of Mind
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_**Way of Suggestion:** 6th level_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can erase yourself<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;from a single creature's sight<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;momentarily. As a bonus action,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;choose a creature within 60 feet<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;of you that you are aware of.<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That creature must make a<br>  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Wisdom saving throw<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;against your universal<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;force save DC. On a<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;failed save, you<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;become invisible to<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that creature for<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;1 minute, or until<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you deal damage to it.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Once you've used this<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature, you can't use it<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;again until you finish a<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short or long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Delicate Potency
_**Way of Suggestion:** 10th level_<br>
Your mind-affecting powers are particularly potent. When you cast one of *cloud mind*, *dominate mind*, *mass coerce mind*, and *dominate monster*, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Delayed Effect
_**Way of Suggestion:** 14th level_<br>
When you cast a force power, you can delay the effects of the force power for up to a number of rounds equal to half your consular level. If you do so, the power immediately takes effect at the start of your turn, after the specified number of rounds have passed.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.

### Subtle Presence
_**Way of Suggestion:** 18th level_<br>
You've learned how to weave the Force around you in a cloak of your choice. As an action, you can focus the Force for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain your choice of one of the following effects. 

You can use each feature once. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Cloak of Fright
Each creature of your choice that is within 60 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

#### Cloak of Invisibility
You and everything you are wearing or carrying become invisible to creatures of your choice. If you damage a creature or affect it with a force power, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a success, you are no longer invisible to that creature.

#### Cloak of Memory
Creatures that see you or any allies within 30 feet of you during this time cannot recall your physical appearances, your mannerisms, or any other identifying features.

Creatures that interact with you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC once the interaction ends. You can choose to exclude a creature from this effect. On a failed save, the creature forgets all details of the interaction, rationalizing any of its outcomes.

## Engineer
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby</span> bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off. 

Inside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can<br> be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety. 

A Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.

Every machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

### Behind the Curtain
While perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

### Unflappable
It takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.

### Creating an Engineer
While creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it. You could be a street-smart mechanic who taught yourself how to fix swoop bikes as a teenager. Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?

#### Quick Build
You can make an engineer quickly by following these<br> suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest<br> ability score. Your next-highest score should be<br> Constitution. Second, choose the scientist<br> background.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | ENGINEER</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Techcasting
_**Engineer:** 1st level_<br>
During your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

#### Tech Powers Known
You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.

You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

___

**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

</div>

___

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or your tool proficiencies granted by this class as a tech focus for your tech powers.

### Potent Aptitude
_**Engineer:** 1st level_<br>
Your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Infuse Item
_**Engineer:** 2nd level_<br>
You gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.

### Tool Expertise
_**Engineer:** 2nd level_<br>
You gain expertise in any tool proficiencies you gain from this class.

### Engineering Discipline
_**Engineer:** 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level_<br>

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Engineer:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Quick Thinking
_**Engineer:** 5th level_<br>
You regain all of your expended uses of Potent Aptitude when you finish a short or long rest.

### Tech Mastery
_**Engineer:** 20th level_<br>
Your mastery of technology is unrivaled. Your Constitution and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.

Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Potent Aptitude left, you regain one use.

## Engineering Disciplines
Each discipline focuses on maximizing the personal use of a certain tool. Your discipline grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | ENGINEER</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Armormech Engineering
Those engineers who choose the Armormech Engineering discipline focus on the ability to work with hard metals and electronic shielding to construct and enhance all types of personal armor.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in armormech's implements, medium armor, and heavy armor. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with armormech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Modified Armor
_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to modify one unenhanced suit of armor or shield utilizing your armormech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify one suit of armor or a shield. You must have the armor or shield and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your modified armor or shield is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

### Damage Absorption
_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to absorb some of that damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

### Extra Attack
_**Armormech Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

### Armormech's Celerity
_**Armormech Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
When you take the Attack action or use your action to a cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Suit Reliability
_**Armormech Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
Your suit is like a second skin. Whenever you make an ability check or saving throw that uses Strength, Dexterity,or Constitution, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

### Armormech Modifications
If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

#### Absorption Shield
_**Prerequisite:** Physical Shield_<br>
You modify your physical shield to block incoming damage. As a bonus action you can activate this ability and gain temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + Intelligence modifier, which last for one hour.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Accelerated Movement
_**Prerequisite:** Armor_<br>
You reduce the weight of your modified armor's bulk and increase the power to joints. If the armor has a Strength requirement, you ignore it. The modified armor's weight is reduced by 15 lbs. While wearing your modified armor your speed increases by 10 feet. This applies to all movement speeds you have while wearing your armor.

#### Adaptable Armor
_**Prerequisite:** Armor_<br>
You integrate deployable hooks and fins into your armor, augmenting its mobility. While wearing your modified armor, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.

#### Advanced Power Fist
_**Prerequisite:** 11th level, Prototype Power Fist_<br>
You further modify your modified armor's gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor's unarmed strike deals 1d8 kinetic damage. Additionally, your critical hit range with your unarmed strikes increases by 1.

#### Artificially Intelligent
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Armor_<br>
You install an artificial intelligence into your modified armor. While wearing your modified armor, when you make an ability check, your armor's artificial intelligence can take the Help action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Bonded Plates
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_<br>
You gain a +1 bonus to AC against melee attacks. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.

#### Collapsible Suit
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level, Armor_<br>
Your modified armor can collapse into a case for easy storage. When transformed this way the armor is indistinguishable from a normal case and weighs one-third its normal weight. As an action you can don or doff the armor, allowing it to transform as needed.

#### Darkvision Visor
_**Prerequisite:** Armor_<br>
While wearing your modified armor, you have darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this modification increases its range by 30 feet.

#### Enhanced Endurance
_**Prerequisite:** Armor_<br>
When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing your modified armor but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

You can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your gadgeteer harness. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden and fixed properties. 

#### Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook
You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.

While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.

## Unstable Engineering
Those engineers who choose the Unstable Engineering discipline create and use untested combinations, resulting in powerfulï¿½and often unpredictableï¿½effects.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Unstable Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in your choice of artisan's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with tinker's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Modified Tinkercannon
_**Unstable Engineering:** 3rd, 9th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to enhance your tinker's implements with unstable science, modifying them into a harness with a cannon. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your tinker's implements to create a tinkercannon. You must have tinker's implements in order to perform this modification.

Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher while wielding your tinkercannon, you risk unexpected complications. Your GM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table to create a random effect. 

Additionally, your tinkercannon come equipped with four overrides, and they gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you trigger an Unstable Engineering Surge, you can use an override to reroll the percentile dice. You must use the new result, you can only do this once per surge, and each time you do so in excess<br> of your proficiency bonus (resetting on a long<br> rest) your maximum tech points is reduced by<br> 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended overrides when you complete a long<br> rest.

### Unstable Volley
_**Unstable Engineering:** 3rd, 9th,<br> &emsp;and 17th level_<br>
While wielding your tinkercannon,<br> as a bonus action you can expend one<br> use of your Potent Aptitude to launch<br> a volley of unstable energy at a<br> surface located within 30 feet of<br> you that you can see. This energy<br> adheres to the surface for 1 minute,<br> after which it erupts. As a part of<br> this bonus action, or as a bonus<br> action on a following turn, you<br> can cause the energy to erupt<br> early. Each creature within 5<br> feet of it must make a<br> Dexterity saving throw against<br> your tech save DC. A creature<br> takes 1d6 lightning damage on a<br> failed save, or half as much on a successful<br> one. 

The range at which you can launch your<br> volley increases to 60 feet at 9th level, and<br> 120 feet at 17th level.

This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

### Creative Destruction
_**Unstable Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You can add your governing ability modifier (minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features that don't already include that modifier. If the tech power or class feature would damage multiple creatures, you can only deal this additional damage to one of them.

If you choose to deal this additional damage, your GM can have you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table.

### Experimental Overrides 
_**Unstable Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
You gain a modicum of control over your surges. Whenever you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table and use one of your overrides, you can choose either total.

### Engineering Bombardment
_**Unstable Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
The harmful energies of your tech powers and class features intensify. When you roll damage for a tech power or class feature and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, you can roll it again and use both results. You can only use this ability once per tech power or class feature.

## Fighter
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A Trandoshan runs frantically across rooftops, constantly</span> looking over his shoulder. As he prepares to leap a gap, a blaster bolt hits him in the back and renders<br> him unconscious. His blurry vision barely<br> makes out the figure of a masked woman<br> who casually approaches, ready to collect her<br> bounty.

With his muscular arms held wide, a<br> grizzled-looking Wookiee grins to his<br> bloodthirsty crowd. He turns back to<br> his arena opponent just in time to<br> see the Besalisk take a swing. He<br> ducks, punching the four-armed<br> fighter in the gut. Two wild<br> haymakers later, and he stands<br> alone as the<br> gladiatorial<br> champion. 

Taking a deep breath, a Republic<br> soldier looks out onto the war zone<br> waging across the frozen surface of<br> Ilum. He grips his blaster rifle tightly<br> then, with a nod to the dozen squad-<br>mates beside him, he charges onto<br> the battlefield. 

Fighters combine discipline with<br> martial skills to become the best<br> pure warriors in the galaxy. Fighters<br> can be stalwart defenders of those in<br> need, cruel marauders, or brave advent-<br>urers. They fight for glory, honor, to right<br> wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or<br> simple for the thrill of battle.

<div style='margin-top:122px'></div>

### All in a Day's Work
Many fighters see adventures, raids on enemy strongholds, and dangerous missions as their jobs. Some want to defend those who can't defend themselves while others seek to use their muscle to carve their own place of importance in the galaxy. Fighters can take the form of guards, champions, bounty hunters, enforcers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, or simply armed explorers.

### Code Red
Most fighters come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military organization. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A fighter may have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life while another may be following a proud family tradition. Whatever their origins, most fighters share an unshakeable loyalty. Fighters follow orders with little hesitation, as failure can often mean death.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:676px'></div>

### Creating a Fighter
While creating your fighter character, consider where<br> your loyalties lie. You could be part of a formal military,<br> one of countless troopers fighting for your enterprise.<br> Perhaps you are a gun-for-hire, traveling the galaxy in<br> search of your next gig. What weapons do you prefer<br> and specialize in? Who or what do you fight for? Do you<br> have aspirations of a life beyond the battlefield, or<br> have you been at war so long you know of nothing<br> else?

#### Quick Build
You can make a fighter quickly by following these<br> suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your<br> highest ability modifier, depending on whether you<br> want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons<br> (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should<br> be Constitution. Second, choose the soldier<br> background.

### Combat Superiority

</div>

___

### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Commander's Strike
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Disarming Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

#### Distracting Strike
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

#### Evasive Footwork
When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

#### Feinting Attack
You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Goading Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

#### Lunging Attack
When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Maneuvering Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. 

That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | FIGHTER</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Menacing Attack 
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

#### Parry
When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

#### Precision Attack
When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

#### Pushing Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Rally
On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.

#### Riposte
When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Sweeping Attack
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Trip Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

Once per turn, when you deal damage with a weapon, you can deal an additional 1d4 damage of the same type as the weapon's damage. If this damage would affect multiple creatures, you can only apply this damage bonus to one of them.

This damage increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.

### Remarkable Athlete

You can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.

### Brutish Durability
_**Assault Specialist:** 7th level_<br>
Once per round, roll 1d6 and add the die to your saving throw total. If applying this bonus to a death saving throw increases the total to 20 or higher, you gain the benefits of rolling a 20 on the d20. You can choose to use this feature before or after you make a saving throw, but you must decide before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.

### Additional Fighting Style
_**Assault Specialist:** 10th level_<br>
You can choose a second fighting style option.

### Devastating Critical

## Heavy Weapons Specialist
Some manned instruments of war require their user to have superior physical prowess to overcome their weight and encumbrance. Those fighters who choose to become Heavy Weapons Specialists use their powerful bodies, and powerful armaments, to overwhelm their foes.

### Rock Steady
_**Heavy Weapons Specialist:** 3rd level_<br>
You have learned to use the heft of your weapon to root yourself in place. At the end of each of your turns, if you move less than half your speed while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid being restrained, moved, or knocked prone. This advantage lasts until the end of your next turn.

### My Little Friend Says Hello There
_**Heavy Weapons Specialist:** 3rd level_<br>
You know how to use the sheer size of your weapon to strike fear in those around you. You can add your Strength modifier to any Charisma (Intimidation) check you make while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties that doesn't already include that modifier.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Maximum Output
_**Heavy Weapons Specialist:** 7th level_<br>
When you take the Attack action while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties, you can forgo one or more attacks. If you do so, the first time you deal damage with the weapon before the start of your next turn, you deal additional damage of the same type as the weapon's damage. If this instance would deal damage to multiple creatures, you can only apply this additional damage to one of them. For each attack you forgo, you deal additional damage equal to 1d12 + half your fighter level (rounded down). If you miss with the first attack roll you make before the end of your next turn, or one target succeeds on the saving throw against your weapon's burst or rapid property, you instead deal normal weapon damage.

### Straight Through
_**Heavy Weapons Specialist:** 10th level_<br>
When you score a critical hit on your turn while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties, you can make one weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of the target using your reaction.

### Overwhelm
_**Heavy Weapons Specialist:** 15th level_<br>
When you use your Second Wind while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties, if you hit with the first attack roll you make, or if one creatures fails the saving throw against your weapon's burst or rapid property, before the end of your next turn, you treat the hit as a critical hit. If you miss with the first attack roll you make before the end of your next turn, or one target succeeds on the saving throw against your weapon's burst or rapid property, you instead deal normal weapon damage.

### Pure Performance
_**Heavy Weapons Specialist:** 18th level_<br>
At 18th level, attack rolls you make while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties can't suffer from disadvantage.

## Guardian
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A dark-skinned human quickly runs down a corridor, the</span> metal armor under his grey cloak clanking with each step. He rounds the corner into the prison while the lights and power are still out, urging the weakened prisoners to escape. Just then a handful of slavers arrive and ready their blasters. The man draws and ignites a white-bladed lightsaber, ready to die for the strangers behind him. 

A sith pureblood, clad head to toe in black and red armor, charges towards a line of soldiers. Shot after shot deflects off his armor until he reaches his prey, where he unleashes his fury in a series of devastating lightsaber sweeps. 

A zabrak general dramatically leaps to his soon-to-be overrun squad, landing with a flurry of lightsaber attacks. At the arrival of this powerful Jedi, the attackers fall back.

Guardians are the master of the art of lightsaber combat. They focus on utilizing the everpresent power of the Force to enable devastating attacks, often single-handedly turning the tide of battle.

<div style='margin-top:205px'></div>

### Protector or Destroyer
An unstoppable agent of the Force, the guardian channels the power flowing through him into his weapons. Their skills with a lightsaber are unrivalled. Subduing their enemies and bolstering their allies, the guardian uses the Force to control what happens around them.

<div style='margin-top:205px'></div>

### Natural Leaders
The guardian's command of the Force lends them a powerful presence. Whether through fear and intimidation or respect and admiration, the guardian is one of the greatest generals on the battlefield. They are a symbol of power to their followers.

### Creating a Guardian
While creating your guardian, consider your attraction to the Force and its most famous practitioners ï¿½ the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you a soldier tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?

#### Quick Build
You can make a guardian quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

<div align="center">

___

### Channel the Force
_**Guardian:** 1st level_<br>
You know how to channel the Force to create a unique effect. You start with your choice of one from two such effects: Cause Harm or Lend Aid. At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.

Some Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your universal force save DC.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Cause Harm
As an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

#### Lend Aid
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a beast or humanoid within 5 feet of you.

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage.

The Force flowing through you makes you immune to poison and disease.

You are so in tune with the Force that all your melee weapon strikes carry the power of the Force with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. If you also use your Force-Empowered Strikes with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Force-Empowered Strikes. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.

\columnbreak

### Cleansing Touch
_**Guardian:** 14th level_<br>
You can use your action and expend a use of your Channel the Force ability to end one force power on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

The auras are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple guardians grant the same aura, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefits of your auras.

#### Aura of Conquest
Whenever a creature who is frightened of you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, its speed is reduced to 0 and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your guardian level.

#### Aura of Conviction

#### Aura of Vigor
Whenever a friendly creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

#### Aura of Warding
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to damage from force powers.

## Makashi Form 
Makashi Form, also known as Contention Form, encourages precision and efficiency over power, using jabs, parries and light cuts over slashes, blocks and chops. Those guardians who focus on Makashi Form utilize calculated blade manipulation, intense focus, and expert timing to confuse and trap their opponents.

### Form Basics

### Channel the Force
_**Makashi Form:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain the following Channel the Force option.

#### Makashi Riposte
When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and use your reaction to attempt to deflect the attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your guardian level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack against that creature as a part of the reaction.

### Shatterpoint
_**Makashi Form:** 7th level_<br>
If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can use your connection to the Force to sense their<br> strengths and weaknesses, and learn certain<br> information about its capabilities<br> compared to your own. The GM tells<br> you if the creature is your equal,<br> superior, or inferior in regard<br> to two of the following<br> characteristics of your<br> choice:
- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Wisdom score
- Charisma score

When you would be affected by a weapon or force power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack, make a melee or ranged force attack against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Monk
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Her vibrostaff a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of</span> blaster bolts, a human springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of pirates on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Taking a deep breath, a zabrak covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging mercenaries reach him, he exhales and a blast of negative energy courses from his hands, engulfing his foes.

Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad mirialan steps into a shadow beneath an arch and nimbly climbs to the balcony a stone's throw above her. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the warlord, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

<div style='margin-top:47px'></div>

### The Power of Focus
Monks make careful study of a mystical energy that most monastic orders call focus. This energy is an element of the power that suffuses the galaxyï¿½specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

<div style='margin-top:47px'></div>

### Training and Asceticism
Most monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other power.

The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/gFdtzpD.png' style='position:absolute;top:69px;right:-70px;width:570px;'/>

### Creating a Monk
As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are typically lawful in alignment.

#### Quick Build
You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the agent background.

### Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are chakrams, techblades, and any simple vibroweapons that don't have the two-handed property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:
- Your unarmed strikes and monk weapons gain the finesse property.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.

> ##### Variant: Monks with Lightweapons
> If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the lightweapon has a vibroweapon analogue. For instance, chakrams count as monk weapons. If a monk gains proficiency in a light ring, they could also use it as a monk weapon.

### Unarmored Defense
_**Monk:** 1st level_<br>
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).

### Focus
_**Monk:** 2nd and 11th level_<br>
Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various focus features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.

You use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma for your focus ability. You use the chosen ability modifier whenever a feature refers to your focus ability. Additionally, you use the chosen ability modifier when making an attack with a focus feature or setting the saving throw DC for one.

___

<div align="center">

**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

___

**Focus attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

</div>

___

#### Flurry of Blows

#### Step of the Wind
When you use your bonus action to Dash, you can spend 1 focus point to double your jump distance for the turn. At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn, though you fall if you end your speed in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

### Monastic Vows
_**Monk:** 2nd, 7th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You've sworn two vows, as detailed at the end of the class description. You swear an additional vow at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Unarmored Movement
_**Monk:** 3rd and 9th level_<br>
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Unarmored Movement column of the monk table.

### Deflect Missiles
_**Monk:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use your reaction to deflect a projectile when you are dealt damage by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, and the damage is kinetic, energy, or ion, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack as you deflect the projectile, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the projectile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

Your focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, when you complete a short rest, you can expend a Hit Die to remove 1 level of exhaustion or slowed.

### Empty Body
_**Monk:** 18th level_<br>
You can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

_**Monk:** 20th level_<br>
You've gained perfect control over your body. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, when you roll for initiative and have fewer than 6 focus points remaining, you regain up to 6 focus points.

#### Vow of the Devoted
You gain a limited ability to manipulate the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

***Force Powers Known.*** You learn 2 force powers of your choice. You learn an additional power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th level. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite. You may only learn universal powers in this way.

***Force Points.*** Rather than force points, powers you learn through this vow are cast using your focus points, at 1 focus point per power level. You may only cast universal powers in this way.

***Max Power Level.*** Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more focus points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels. Your Max Power Level is 1st. It increases to 2nd at 7th level, 3rd at 13th level, and 4th at 17th level. You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

***Forcecasting Ability.*** You use your focus ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. If a power you cast with focus points calls for a saving throw, you use your focus save DC. If a power you cast with focus points calls for an attack roll, you use your focus attack modifier.

On a failed save, for the next minute, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it must make an additional Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this feature doesn't restrict its movement for that turn. 

This feature ends early if you attack another creature, if you target another hostile creature with a power or class feature, if a friendly creature damages the target, if a friendly creature targets it with a power or class feature, or if you target another creature with this feature.

#### Echani's Shot
You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an Echani weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an Echani weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.

## Nightsister Order

## Operative
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A Bothan spy takes a moment to adjust her infrared goggles.</span> Nimbly sidestepping the laser grid in the room, she slips to the computer at the far end. Counting down the seconds in her head, she slices the mainframe. Twenty seconds. Ten seconds. A handful of soldiers bursts into the room, but she is already gone ï¿½ with the data in hand. 

With a wary eye on the door, a scruffy-looking Duros plays pazaak in a seedy cantina. When two city guards appear at the exit, he smiles and reaches under the table. Before they can move in, the smuggler flips the table and opens fire. The crowd scatters in panic, giving him just enough cover to escape. 

A gorgeous young human dances before an intoxicated senator in his parlor. She winks enticingly through her golden blonde hair as she sways closer. Leaning in for a kiss, the senator is instead surprised by the barrel of a hold-out blaster pistol shoved into his mouth. He has no time to shout before the assassin pulls the trigger. 

Operatives, whether good, bad, or neutral, are those who focus on a specific practice and utilize it to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region in the galaxy, with origins from the lowliest scoundrel to the once social elite.

<div style='margin-top:137px'></div>

### Evading Danger
Operatives have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous operatives are also saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. No matter what their immediate concerns may be, survival is the name of the game.

<div style='margin-top:137px'></div>

### Outside the Law
Operatives don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.

### Creating an Operative
While creating your operative character, consider how you first started on your path. Maybe you were raised on the street and fell into the criminal element as a means of survival. You could be a simple trader who decided to strike against the Sith Empire when it encroached on your business. What would you say is your greatest skill set? What is your core, the truest essence about yourself that keeps you focused? Why would society treat you as a criminal, yet your allies hold you as a loyal companion?

#### Quick Build
You can make an operative quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence or Charisma. Second, choose the gambler background.

#### Fighter's Exploit
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. 

#### Freedom's Exploit
You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.

You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.

#### Skill's Exploit
You learn an exploit that enhances your ability to apply your knowledge to combat situations. You can take this exploit multiple times.

When you take the Attack action, you can use one of your skill exploits granted by this feature. You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Acquisitions Practice
Many operatives are hired for the procurement of valuable artifacts, but only the true masters of the art can slip through the tightest security and make off with untold riches, whether they do it for a profit, or for sport. Those operatives who choose the Acquisitions Practice apply a mixture of stealth and impressive acrobatics to surpass any kind of defenses they are met with.

### Fast and Agile
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your demolitions kit or security kit to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

Additionally, climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and you gain the ability to move in flying leaps with incredible speed, precision, and power. When you move, instead of using your walking speed, you may take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a solid object, a surface, or on the ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends. If you Dash, your bonus movement is applied to your normal speed, not this movement. 

### Deft Hands
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn a number of<br> techniques to distract<br> and confuse your<br> opponents. When<br> you deal Sneak<br> Attack damage,<br> you may choose<br> to forgo two of<br> your Sneak<br> Attack dice<br> to perform<br> a deft hand<br> maneuver.

Some of your deft hand maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Deft Hands save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Hinder
You attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.

#### Pilfer
You attempt to pick your target's pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.

#### Tumble
You attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.

### Supreme Sneak
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. Additionally, as long as you aren't incapacitated, you no longer take damage from falling less than 100 feet, and have resistance to falling damage.

### Aerial Agility
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 13th level_<br>
Your agility in the air grants you the following benefits:
- When you move, you can instead take 3 short movements by flying.
- Whenever you end your flying movement and you are within 5 feet of a climbable surface, you can grab onto that surface as though you were climbing upon it.

### Thief's Reflexes
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

Additionally, you learn to utilize the momentum of your fall to make deadly vertical strikes. Whenever you fall at least 50 feet and land within 5 feet of an enemy creature you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack is a Sneak Attack, you can deal three additional weapon dice worth of damage and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Fascinating Display
_**Beguiler Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You can spend 1 minute attemping to distract and enthrall those around you. Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Mesmerizing Presence

You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures charmed by you.

### Distracting Countenance
_**Beguiler Practice:** 17th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can mask yourself<br> with the Force for 1 minute or until you<br> are incapacitated. For the duration,<br> whenever any creature tries to<br> attack you for the first time on a<br> turn, the attacker must make a<br> Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 +<br> your proficiency bonus + your<br> Charisma modifier). On a failed<br> save, it can't attack you on this<br> turn, and it must choose a new<br> target for its attack or the attack<br> is wasted. On a successful save,<br> it can attack you on this turn, but<br> it has disadvantage on any<br> saving throw it makes against<br> your powers on your next<br> turn.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

You learn to quickly move into cover when under fire. Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required).

## Sharpshooter Practice
Those operatives who choose the Sharpshooter Practice are bringers of death. Striking from a safe distance, the Sharpshooter uses precision shooting to control the battlefield and bring targets down quickly.

### Assume the Position
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if your target is greater than 30 feet from you and no enemies are within 5 feet of you. Additionally, standing up from prone now only costs 5 feet of movement.

Additionally, you gain proficiency with two martial blasters of your choice.

### Placed Shots
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You perfect the art of placing distant shots for maximum effectiveness in debilitating and controlling your enemies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a placed shot. 

Some of your placed shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the placed shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Placed Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Disarming Shot
You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands at its feet.

#### Penetrating Shot
You attempt to damage another target with the same attack. Choose a second target within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second target, it takes two dice worth of Sneak Attack damage.

The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Suppressive Shot
You attempt to pin the target to its location. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

You are at your deadliest when your enemies are unaware of the danger they are in. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet. 

Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Distracting Shot
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You are able to defend your compatriots from afar. When a friendly creature you can see within your weapon's normal range is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a saving throw, and the source of the effect is within your weapon's normal range, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the source. On a hit, instead of dealing damage, the target of your attack has disadvantage on the attack roll against your ally, or your ally has advantage on the saving throw to resist the effect.

### Double Tap
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You've learned to capitalize when you have the advantage. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do, you can make an additional attack against the target or another creature within 5 feet of it (no action required). Both attacks can benefit from your Sneak Attack damage, instead of only one.

## Scholar
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">An overwhelming horde of tusken raiders bears down on a</span> chiss and her fellow adventurers. She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.

Deep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a nautolan tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.

A twi'lek in fine vestments addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape. 

Scholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.

<div style='margin-top:167px'></div>

### The Pursuit of Knowledge
A true scholar is never satisfied. They are always<br> seeking out a new answer to a new question. This<br> often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of<br> adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or<br> accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often<br> times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage.<br> Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as<br> officers in the military.

<div style='margin-top:167px'></div>

### To Learn, To Know
For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life<br> becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be<br> found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will<br> often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous<br> places to find something to quench their thirst for<br> knowledge.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPxvPXQ.png' style='position:absolute;top:37px;right:65px;width:330px;z-index:1000' />

### Creating a Scholar
As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where<br> you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an<br> apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or<br> other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your<br> own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes<br> found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for<br> knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always<br> wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have<br> something to prove? Think about what field you wish to<br> pursue and think of what is driving you in that<br> direction.

#### Quick Build
You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second, choose the noble background.

You are able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency.

##### Side Effects

| d20 | Side Effects  |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1. |
| 2  | The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze. |
| 3 | The creature's legs become swollen. The creature gains 1 slowed level. |
| 4 | The creature becomes one size larger or smaller. |
| 5 | The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC. |
| 6 | The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level. | 
| 7 | The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.|

| 9 | The creature gains advantage on perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage. |
| 10 | The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.|
| 11  | The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.  |
| 12  |  The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage. |
| 13 | The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft. |
| 14 | The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare. |
| 15 | The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.|
| 16 | The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion. |
| 17 | The creature believes they are the chosen one. |
| 18 | The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved. |
| 19 | The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage. |

When you make an attack roll, and the result is less than 20, you can expend a superiority die and roll it, adding it to the roll. If the resulting sum is 20 or 23, the attack is considered a critical hit.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Blind Luck
When you fail an ability check, you can expend a superiority die. If the result of your ability check plus the superiority die is within a range equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) above or below the check's DC, you pass the check instead. 

#### Double Bluff
If on the same round of combat that you have missed a weapon attack, an enemy also misses you with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and make a single weapon attack, adding the results of your superiority die to both the attack and damage rolls.

#### The Idiot's Array
When a creature hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you take minimum damage on the damage roll and subtract the value of the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead take the maximum.

#### Played Their Hand
When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the attacker's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice) as a part of this reaction.<br> On a success, the target drops the weapon it<br> made the attack with. If you are within 5 feet<br> of the target, and you have a free hand, you<br> can catch the item. Otherwise, the object<br> lands at its feet.

\pagebreak

#### Pure Sabacc 
When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you deal maximum damage on the weapon's damage roll, including the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead deal the minimum.

#### Raise the Stakes
When the target of your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. Roll the die and subtract the result from the enemy's attack roll, but add the result to their damage roll on a hit.

#### Take a Chance
Before making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.

#### Tiebreaker
When you roll a superiority die as a part of a maneuver you learned from this class, you can expend another superiority die and use the total of both dice.

### Lucky Number 7
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
Whenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain a superiority die. You can not have more superiority dice than the amount shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar table.

When attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.

### Tell Me the Odds
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
If the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).

This die increases to d10 at 13th level and d12 at 17th level.

### Borrowed Luck
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
You have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.

While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.

### Gambler Discoveries
When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. 

#### Ace Up Your Sleeve
Whenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can expend a superiority die, adding the result to your total for the check.

#### Against the House
Whenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling, you can instead challenge the target to a game of chance. If they accept your offer, you can make an ability check with an available gaming set. If you win the challenge, you automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.

#### Ante Up
When you roll initiative, are not surprised, and end up first in the initiative order, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action during your first turn in combat.

#### Calculated Bluff
When you make an ability check using your Charisma, you can choose to instead make the check using your Intelligence.

#### Cold Read
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_<br>
As an action, you may make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by a target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you know the next action the target intends to take, so long as the situation does not change dramatically.

#### Feeling the Pressure
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
Whenever you roll a 4 or higher on your Risk Versus Reward feature, the target of your Critical Analysis feature also has disadvantage on attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.

#### The Magic Number
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
Whenever you roll a 7 on an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the ability check or saving throw with advantage.

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable.

The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

## Scout
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rough and grizzled looking, a human stalks alone through</span> the shadows of trees, hunting the quarry he knows is planning a raid on a nearby settlement. Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.

After tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile's<br> explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two<br> shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank.<br> Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to<br> permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe,<br> firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick<br> armor.

Glancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.

Scouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Deadly Hunters
Warriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilizationï¿½humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.

Scouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers<br> through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like<br> their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and<br> the hunt. A scout's talents and abilities are honed with<br> deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the<br> civilization.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Independent Adventurers
Though a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout's true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the firstï¿½and possibly the lastï¿½line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:525px'></div>

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/8Nj1Jxq.png' style='position:absolute;top:22px;right:10px;width:386px;z-index:1000' />

### Creating a Scout
As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slainï¿½perhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. 

What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?

What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

#### Quick Build
You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the bounty hunter background.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | SCOUT</div>

## Bulwark Technique
Some scouts find themselves far from civilization not to hunt, gather intelligence, or escape danger, but to venture forth simply to defend those unable to defend themselves. Followers of the Bulwark Technique make use of advanced technology to contain those that threaten the undeserving.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Personal Barrier
_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain access to a powerful personal barrier. Whenever you complete a short or long rest, you create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a short or long rest. That barrier has hit points equal to twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.

Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, your barrier regains hit points equal to the number of tech points spent.

Additionally, for as long as your barrier has hit points, you gain the following benefits:
- You are considered proficient in Constitution saving throws for the purpose of maintaining concentration on tech powers.
- Hostile creatures that hit you with melee attacks take energy damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

### Mark of the Bulwark
_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
When the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature makes a melee attack against a friendly creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the attack to target you instead. If the attack hits, and your Personal Barrier has hit points, the attacking creature takes bonus damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.

### Projected Barrier
_**Bulwark Technique:** 7th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You've learned how to manipulate your barrier to create new effects. As an action, you can spend three of your barrier's hit points to create a unique effect. You have three such effects: Projected Sphere, Projected Maelstrom, and Projected Wave. When you use your Projected Barrier, you choose which effect to create.

Some Projected Barrier Effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

If your barrier's hit points are reduced to 0, any Projected Barrier features immediately end.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Projected Sphere
You create a protective spherical barrier in a 5-foot-radius sphere a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures within the barrier have three-quarters cover from attacks originating from outside the barrier. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required).

#### Projected Maelstrom
You create an unstable energy maelstrom in a 5-foot cube at a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. A creature takes 4d4 energy damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required). 

This feature's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 11th level (5d4) and 17th level (6d4).

#### Projected Wave
You create a wave of barrier energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 energy damage and is pushed back to the edge of the cone. On a success, they take half damage and<br> aren't pushed.

This feature's damage increases by 1d6<br> when you reach 11th level (3d6) and 17th<br> level (4d6).

### Regenerative Shielding
_**Bulwark Technique:** 11th level_<br>
When a hostile creature forces you to<br> make a saving throw and you succeed,<br> your personal barrier regains hit points<br> equal to your Intelligence<br> modifier.

### Adaptive Barrier
_**Bulwark Technique:** 15th level_<br>
When your personal barrier takes<br> damage, you can have it gain<br> resistance to subsequent<br> damage of that type until<br> the start of your next turn<br> (no action required). If it<br> takes damage of more<br> than one type<br> simultaneously,<br> you can choose<br> which type it gains<br> resistance to. Your<br> barrier can only have<br> resistance to one<br> type of damage at a time.

## Sentinel
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Clad in black robes, the rattataki pulls his hood forward and</span> steps into the shadowy alcove, only to reappear further down the hall. As his quarry walks past, he presses the hilt of his lightsaber to the back of their head, quickly toggling it on-and-off. He is gone before the corpse hits the ground.

The togruta dashes across the battlefield, doublesaber deflecting blaster shots to the ground. She pulls her wounded padawan to her feet, and guides her away from the warzone.

Green-bladed lightsaber a blur, the cathar ferociously presses the attack. With each strike, she guides her opponent closer to the ravine's edge. A flurry of blows followed by a quick *force push* and her foe tumbles over the edge.

Sentinels are the masters of blending force powers with weapon attacks. They weave the two together so expertly that their foes have trouble predicting them.

<div style='margin-top:212px'></div>

### The Middle of the Road
The sentinel uses stealth and subterfuge to accomplish the will of the Force. Where the consular focuses on mastery of the Force and the guardian focuses on the mastery of the lightsaber, the sentinel focuses on merging the two. 

<div style='margin-top:212px'></div>

### Solitary Action
Sentinels are notoriously independent, most comfortable acting alone and without backup; where some use a team to make up for their weaknesses, the sentinel uses the Force to overcome theirs. While some take this independent streak to the extreme, they are usually accepting of authority, as long as they are allowed to carry out directions using their preferred methods.

### Creating a Sentinel
While creating your sentinel, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners ï¿½ the Jedi and the Sith.  Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you an operative tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?

#### Quick Build
You can make a sentinel quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom or Charisma. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

### Forcecasting
_**Sentinel:** 1st level_<br>
In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 7 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the sentinel table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your sentinel level x 3, as shown in the Force Points column of the sentinel table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the sentinel table.

You may only cast force powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

_**Sentinel:** 2nd level_<br>
Your training allows you to harness the mystical energy of the Force throughout your body.

Each effect uses a d4, which changes as you gain sentinel levels, as shown in the Kinetic Combat column of the sentinel table. You have three such effects: Deflection, Double Strike, and Slow Time. You can only use each effect once per turn, and you can only use one effect per hit.

When you are subjected to an effect that forces you to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 force points to add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to the saving throw if doesn't already include that modifier. If you do so, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. You can wait until after you roll the d20 to use this feature, but you must decide before the GM says it succeeds or fails.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES | SENTINEL</div>

On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy.

## Path of Aggression
From the murky depths of the dark side comes seething fury. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Aggression charge their weapon with lightning, culminating in a massive discharge that can ravage their opponents.

### Voltaic Slash
_**Path of Aggression:** 3rd level_<br>
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *lightning charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit the target.

## Path of Focus
The ways of the Force can reveal themselves to a sentinel through intense concentration and, most importantly, focus.

### Focused Burst
_**Path of Focus:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *burst* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action.

When you deal damage to a creature within 5 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Blade Storm
_**Path of Focus:** 7th level_<br>

### Focused Flow
_**Path of Focus:** 13th level_<br>
Whenever you use a Force-Empowered Self feature, you may instead expend no force points and roll a d4 in place of your Kinetic Combat die.

### Master Strike
_**Path of Focus:** 18th level_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;At 18th level, your bursts can overpower even<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the fiercest of foes. Once on your turn,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when a creature takes damage from <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; you three times, you can force it to<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make a Constitution saving throw<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; against your universal force<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save DC. On a failed save,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it becomes stunned<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until the end of its<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next turn.

## Path of the Forceblade
Some few master their weapon in ways that differ from their peers. Those sentinels who follow the Path of the Forceblade channel the Force into their weapon, forming a unique connection that grants you greater control over the weapon; it becomes an extension of their will.

### Phasethrow
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *saber throw* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you no longer have disadvantage on the attack roll with it if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit a target. Finally, when you hit a creature within with the *saber throw* force power, you deal additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Forceblade Bond
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn how to bond with a light- or vibro-weapon through the Force, making it part of you.

You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond, gaining the following benefits:
- You can't be disarmed of that<br> weapon while you are conscious. 
- If the weapon is within 60 feet of you and<br> you can see it, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to travel instantly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.
- You can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.

You can have two weapons bonded to you in this way at a time, and you can summon both of them to you with the same bonus action.

### Twin Saber Throw
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 7th level_<br>
When you cast *saber throw* while<br> wielding your forceblade, you can<br> attack the same target multiple times.

Additionally, when you deal damage to a creature within 30 feet of you with your forceblade, you can use your bonus action to teleport to within 5 feet of<br> that creature and make a melee weapon attack<br> against that creature. This attack uses your<br> Kinetic Combat die instead of your weapon's<br> damage die. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma<br> modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all<br> expended uses when you complete a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Disruptive Throw
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 13th level_<br>
When you are the target of a ranged attack, and the source is within range of your *saber throw* force power, you can use your reaction to throw your forceblade at the source of the attack. Make a ranged force attack. On a hit, this attack deals damage using your Kinetic Combat die instead of the weapon's damage die and you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.

### Forceblade Mastery
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 18th level_<br>
You've mastered controlling your forceblade with your mind, using it to keep your enemies at bay. As an action, you can telekinetically control your forceblade and have it strike any number of creatures within 10 feet of you, spending 1 force point per target. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to weapon attack rolls with that weapon). On a failed save, it takes damage using your Kinetic Combat die + half your sentinel level (rounded down), is pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.

### Dead Silence
_**Path of Shadows:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *psychic charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit the target.

You learn to strike from the shadows. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the roll. 

The extra damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.

### Shadow Step
_**Path of Shadows:** 13th level_<br>
You gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. While you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim<br> light or darkness. You then have advantage on the<br> first melee attack you make before the end of the<br> turn.

### Shadow's Wrath
_**Path of Shadows:** 18th level_<br>
Your training has taught you advanced techniques while you maneuver in the shadows. While you are hidden from your target, the first attack roll you<br> make each round does not automatically reveal<br> your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check<br> against your target's Wisdom (Perception) check.<br> On a success, you remain hidden. If you are also invisible, you remain invisible.

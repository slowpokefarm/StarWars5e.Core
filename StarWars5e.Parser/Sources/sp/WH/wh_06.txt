# Chapter 6: Customization Options

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he combination of ability scores, species, class, and</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the GM's permission—want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability s cores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

#### Class Weapon Proficiencies
Certain classes—berserker, consular, engineer, fighter, guardian, and scout—have proficiency in all of a type of weapon. For instance, fighters are proficient in all blasters and all vibroweapons. Consequently, fighters have proficiency in all blasters and vibroweapons present in Chapter 5. Other classes—monks, operatives, scholars, and sentinels—have proficiency in a certain set of weapons. For each of these classes, they gain proficiency in only certain weapons, as shown below in the Weapon Proficiencies by Class table:

## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

The feats presented in this chapter should be considered valid options for background feats.

### Augmented Cyborg
You've experimented with cybernetic augmentations, granting the following benefits: 
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one cybernetic augmentation of standard rarity from Appendix A. That augmentation is installed and doesn't count against the maximum cybernetic augmentations you can support, but it does count towards your total cybernetics augmentations as shown in the Cybernetic Augmentations Side Effects table in Chapter 7.

### Climber
You excel at scaling cliffsides, hills, trees, and general climbing. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.
- You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid falling off or down while climbing. 
- You can spend 5 minutes instructing, pointing out handholds, and guiding other creatures before making a climb. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you. Each creature can add a 1d6 to any ability check or saving throw they make for that climb.

### Customized Droid
_**Prerequisite:** Class I, II, III, IV, or V Droid_<br>
You've been customized beyond other droids of the same model, granting the following benefits: 
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one droid customization of standard rarity from Appendix A. That customization is installed and doesn't count against the maximum droid customizations you can support, but it does count towards your maximum parts as shown in the Droid Size Maximum Parts table in Chapter 7.

### Mariner
You've spent an exorbitant amount of time in water. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Constitution by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain a swimming speed equal to your movement speed.
- You have advantage on a ability checks and saving throws related to swimming.
- You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + twice your Constitution modifier.

### Prone Combatant
You've practiced fighting while prone, gaining the following benefits:
- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain a crawling speed equal to your movement speed.
- You no longer have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls against targets within 30 feet.
- When you attempt to hide on your turn while prone, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, you are considered lightly obscured. You lose this benefit if you move or stand up, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden. If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.

### Savage Shorty
_**Prerequisite:** Strength 13, size Small_<br>
Despite being short of stature, your size has no impact on your strength and virility. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your speed increases by 5 feet.
- You lose the Undersized special trait.

### Shard Modification
_**Prerequisite:** Creature type: droid_<br>
You are specially modified droid used to house a shard. Shards are sentient crystals native to the planet Orax, roughly a foot in length, that communicate with each other through pulses of light. While inhabiting a specialized droid host, shards are able to overcome the droid's inability to wield the Force, granting the following benefits:
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You lose the Force Insensitive special trait.
- You can cast the *sense force* force power once per day. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for this power.

### Tiny Terror
_**Prerequisite:** Strength 13, size Tiny_<br>
Despite falling below knee height of other species, your size has less impact on your strength and virility. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your speed increases by 5 feet.
- You lose the Pintsized special trait, and you are no longer limited to +3 when determing your bonus to attack and damasge rolls for weapon attacks using Strength due to the Puny special trait.
- You gain the Undersized special trait: ***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can’t use heavy shields or martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two-hands.

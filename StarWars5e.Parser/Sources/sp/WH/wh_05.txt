<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he cities of *Star Wars* are diverse and multicultural,</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varying dramatically by planet and system. Commonplace activities in one city might be taboo in another. The most common species on one planet might be shunned on the next one. Every city, in addition to the climate and cultures, varies dramatically in the options available for sale.

In addition to those options available in the *Player's Handbook*, adventurers might encounter new and interesting wares. On some planets, and in some cultures, armor is made from unique materials that grant it interesting properties. On other planets, a more diverse armory might be available for purchase—or theft. In other places still, interesting and unique adventuring implements might be discovered.

#### Additional Wealth
Whether starting a campaign at a higher level, or simply adopting the rules included in *Wretched Hives*, your characters might find themselves wanting for credits. If that is the case, consider offering them additional wealth, depending on their level, as shown below in the Additional Starting Wealth by Level table.

##### Additional Wealth by Level

#### Starting Equipment
When choosing the starting equipment for your class, you might have an option to choose any of a certain type of item. For instance, berserkers get a choice of "*(a)* a martial vibroweapon and a light or medium physical shield or *(b)* two martial vibroweapons". When choosing starting equipment in this fashion, the items available in this chapter should not be included. However, if you use instead use the Variant: Starting Wealth by Class rule, the items in this chapter should be considered available for purchase.

#### Ammunition
Blasters that deal energy or ion damage use power cells, while blasters that deal kinetic damage use slug cartridges. This chapter introduces blasters that deal new damage types: acid, fire, and sonic. These weapons also use power cells.

### Buying and Selling Treasure
This chapter introduces armor, weapons, adventuring gear, and other valuable materials. Like those options found in the *Player's Handbook*, selling these items should generally be possible, provided they are unspoiled. 

#### Enhanced Items
Enhanced items are scare and powerful, leading to them rarely having a predetermined price. Buying and selling enhanced items can rarely be performed easily, often requiring extensive time and credits to find a potential buyer and seller. 

#### Rare Materials
While rare materials, as the name indicates, are more scarce than their raw material counterparts, they typically have a commonly accepted value across markets. While they won't always be available for sale, they will usually fetch the same price across worlds.

## Armor and Shields
Adventuring through the different worlds of *Star Wars* shows limitless variety across cultures, varying drastically by their values and technological availability. Many cultures create similar items, but using different materials, granting their items a unique flair. The Armor table shows some examples of how commonly available types of armor found in the game differ, depending on the materials used.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of these types of armor worn in the worlds of *Star Wars*.

### Armor and Shield Proficiency
Anyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't force- or tech-cast.

If you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well.

### Armor Class (AC)
Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your Armor Class.

### Armor Materials
In addition to form and function, armor varies greatly based on material. Beyond those standard materials universally available to armor, you might find armor made with more specialized and scarce materials. Armor made with these materials offers a unique strength, but also a weakness. Additionally, the armor's cost increases by an amount, based on the armor's type, as shown in the Armor Type Cost Increase table below:

##### Armor Type Cost Increase

<div style='column-count:2'>

|Armor<br> Type|Cost<br> Increase|
|:--|--:|
|Light armor|1,000 cr|
|Medium armor|2,000 cr|
|Heavy armor|6,000 cr|

|Armor<br> Type|Cost<br> Increase|
|:--|--:|
|Light shield|250 cr|
|Medium shield|750 cr|
|Heavy shield|1,500 cr|

</div>

&emsp;Only physical shields can be crafted using alternative armor materials.

### Armor Properties
Many armors and shield have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Armor table.

#### Absorptive
When you are wearing armor or wielding a shield with the absorptive property, damage that you take from weapons is reduced by an amount equal to the absorptive number. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1.

#### Anchor
A shield with the anchor property can be used to provide cover. As an action, you can anchor or recover the shield. While anchored, you gain no benefit from a shield, and it does not require the use of a hand. Instead, while anchored, a light shield provides one-quarter cover, a medium shield provides half cover, and a heavy shield provides three-quarters cover.

#### Avoidant
When wearing armor or wielding a shield with the avoidant property and a creature makes an attack against you, the critical hit range decreases by an amount equal to the avoidant number, to a minimum of 1.

#### Barbed

#### Charging
When you take damage while wearing armor or wielding a shield with the charging property, you gain a charge. You can store a maximum number of charges equal to the charging number, and the charges last for 1 minute. The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack while you have charges, you deal additional damage of the same type as the weapon's damage equal to the number of charges stored.

#### Concealing
While wielding a shield with the concealing property, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sight.

#### Cumbersome
While wearing armor or wielding a shield with the cumbersome property, your speed is reduced by 5.

#### Gauntleted

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Imbalanced
When you are critically hit while wielding this shield, you can't take reactions until the start of your next turn, and you gain no AC benefit from your shield against the next attack against you before the start of your next turn.

#### Impermeable
Armor with the impermeable property functions as an enviro-suit, flight suit, and water suit.

#### Insulated
While wearing armor or wielding a shield with the insulated property, you gain a bonus to AC and saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage equal to the insulated number.

#### Interlocking
While wielding a shield with the interlocking property within 5 feet of a friendly creature who is also wielding a shield with the interlocking property, you can both use your reactions to interlock the shields. While interlocked, both creatures gain a bonus to AC equal to the interlocking number. If at any point the creatures are more than 5 feet from eachother, the shields immediately de-interlock, and this effect ends.

#### Lambent
While wielding a shield with the lambent property, you can use a bonus action to activate or deactivate the shield's light. While active, the shield sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the shield's light is active that rely on sight have disadvantage.

#### Lightweight
Armor and shields with the lightweight property have their weight reduced by half.

#### Magnetic 
While you are wielding a shield with the magnetic property and a melee weapon attack misses you by an amount less than or equal to your bonus to AC from your shield, the attacking creature must make a Strength saving throw, DC equal to the magnetic number. On a failed save, the creature's weapon adheres to the shield. As an action, a creature can repeat this check. On a success, the weapon is freed. 

#### Obscured
While wearing armor with the obscured property, electronic sensors and cameras have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks against you that rely on sight.

#### Powered

## Weapons
In addition to armor varying across myriad planets, you might find new and unique types of weaponry available. Your weapon proficiencies reflect the tools you are most likely to use. The Weapons tables show additional weapons used in the worlds of *Star Wars*, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. 

### Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The three types of weapons—blaster, lightweapon, and vibroweapon, are further broken down into two categories—simple and martial.Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

Proficiency in these weapons is discussed further in Chapter 6.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Auto
Automatic weapons can only fire in burst and rapid mode.

#### Defensive
When you make your first attack on your turn with a weapon with the defensive property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to attack and damage rolls with that weapon up to the defensive number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to AC. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.

#### Dire
Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the dire property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the dire number. If you do so and you hit with it, you gain the same bonus to the damage roll.

#### Disarming
When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the disarming property against a creature that is holding an object, you can attempt to disarm the target (no action required). If the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your choice of either your Strength or Dexterity modifier) or it drops an object of your choice at its feet.

#### Disguised
You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to hide the nature of a disguised weapon.

#### Disintegrate
When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a Constitution saving throw, DC equal to the disintegrate number. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

#### Disruptive
When a creature is forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage from a weapon with the disruptive property, the DC for the check equals 10 or the full damage taken, whichever number is higher, instead of only half.

#### Keen
When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.

#### Mighty
When making an attack with a mighty weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Piercing
Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the piercing property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the piercing number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to the next attack roll you make against the same target before the start of your next turn.

#### Rapid
When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the rapid property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to ranged weapon attacks). On a failed save, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal. If the target is beyond normal range but within long range, it has advantage on the save.

#### Shocking
When you hit a creature with a weapon with the shocking property, you can force it to make a Dexterity saving throw, DC equal to the shocking number. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 lightning damage and becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.

#### Silent
When you make a ranged attack with a weapon with the silent property while hidden, it does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by your targets' Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden.

#### Vicious
Whenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described to below.

#### ARC Caster
When you score a critical hit with this weapon, a creature becomes shocked until the end of their next turn.

#### Bolas
A Large or smaller creature hit by a bolas is restrained until it is freed. A bolas has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Dexterity check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The bolas has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the bolas frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the bolas's effects. While a creature is restrained by a bolas, you can make no further attacks with it.

Due to their unwieldy nature, bolas make ineffective melee weapons. Melee attack rolls made with them are made at disadvantage.

#### Bo-Rifle
The bo-rifle is a lasat weapon most commonly carried by the Honor Guard of Lasan, which has the unique property of functioning as both a rifle and a staff. On your turn, you can use your object interaction to switch between modes, detailed below. 

***Rifle.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

***Staff.*** While in this mode, the weapon gains the shocking 13 property.

#### Grenade Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade's explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

#### Handwraps
Handwraps are worn over the hands. When you hit with a melee weapon attack using handwraps, you use your unarmed strike damage instead of the weapon's damage. Additionally, while wearing handwraps, when pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 10 feet, instead of 5.

#### Interchangeable Weapons System
The IWS is a heavy weapon that can fire in three different modes. On your turn, you can use your object interaction to switch between modes, detailed below. 

***Antiarmor.*** While in this mode, rather than traditional power cells, the IWS fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade's explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

***Blaster.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

***Sniper.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Mancatcher
When you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to attempt to grapple a creature while wielding a weapon with the grappling property, you can instead make a melee weapon attack with it. If the attack hits, the creature becomes grappled by you, and it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier of the same type as the weapon's damage.

#### Needler
The needler includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 10 shots fired by the weapon.

#### Retrosaber
The retrosaber is an an ancient type of lightweapon that requires a power cell to function. Once four attacks have been made with a retrosaber, a character must replace the power cell using an action or bonus action (the character's choice). You must have one free hand to replace the power cell.

#### Rocket Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets.

#### Rotary Cannon
Rather than traditional power cells, the rotary cannon uses specialized power generator that allow it to fire continuously for 10 minutes. Replacing a power generator takes an action.

The rotary cannon requires the use of a tripod unless you meet its strength requirement, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can deploy or collapse the rotary cannon on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.

#### Tranquilizer Rifle 
The tranquilizer rifle includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 4 shots fired by the weapon.

#### Vapor Projector
The vapor projector does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the vapor projector uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tank's effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition you're using as you fire it (no action required).

## Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

### Ammunition

#### Blight Cartridge
A blight cartridge is a specialized slug cartridge for use with blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage. When you hit with a shot with the loaded weapon, the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

#### Cryo Cell
A cryo cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons that deal acid, energy, fire, ion, or sonic damage. The loaded weapon deals cold damage instead of its normal damage type, and when you hit with a shot the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 cold damage has its speed reduced by 5 feet until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.

#### Deafening Cell
A deafening cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons that deal acid, energy, fire, ion, or sonic damage. The loaded weapon deals sonic damage instead of its normal damage type, and when you hit with a shot the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 sonic damage and is deafened until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't deafened. 

#### Disruptor Cartridge
A disruptor cartridge is a specialized slug cartridge for use with blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage. When you hit with a shot with the loaded weapon, the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d6 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with the loaded weapon, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized. 

#### Flux Collimator
As an action, you can apply this collimator to one lightweapon within 5 feet, granting it a +1 bonus to damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon.

#### Missile, Ion
This wrist launcher ammunition deals 1d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, hit or miss, the missile then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 ion damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any electronics within the blast radius that aren't being worn or carried are disabled until rebooted.

#### Missile, Plasma
This wrist launcher ammunition deals 1d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, hit or miss, the missile then explodes, setting the ground beneath it in a 15 foot radius ablaze for 1 minute. When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage or half as much on a successful one. A construct makes this save with disadvantage.

#### Oscillation Calibrator
As an action, you can apply this calibrator to one vibroweapon within 5 feet, granting it a +1 bonus to damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon.

#### Plasma Cell
A plasma cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons that deal acid, energy, fire, ion, or sonic damage. The loaded weapon deals fire damage instead of its normal damage type, and when you hit with a shot it sets the ground beneath it in a 5-foot square ablaze for 1 minute. When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage or half as much on a successful one. A construct makes this save with disadvantage.

#### Power Generator
Power generators energize the rotary cannon.

#### Projector Canister, Corrosive
When triggered, this wrist launcher ammunition produces a spray of acid in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 acid damage, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't disadvantaged. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

### Clothing
#### Clothes, Clandestine
These clothes come with four hidden pockets, each of which can store up to 1 lb. Finding these hidden pockets requires a DC 15 Investigation check.

#### Sunshades
These shades are worn over the eyes. While worn, you can no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. However, while worn, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in dim light.

### Communications

#### Personal Translator
A personal translator is a hand held device that can translate verbal communications between up to five languages. The languages can be changed out while interfaced with a protocol droid or appropriate computer.

#### Vocoder Mask
A vocoder mask is worn over the nose and mouth of a creature, and can translate verbal communications between up to 15 languages. The languages can be changed out while interfaced with a protocol droid or appropriate computer.

### Data Recording and Storage
#### Credit Chip
The credit chip is a small, flat card that features a security codeout and algorithm memory stripes. The chip can be preloaded with a specified number of credits, or it can draw directly from a specific account held by the user. The credit chip can be accessed with a pin, or by a DC 20 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check.

### Explosives

#### Grenade, Flash
Flash grenades are hand-held explosive devices that release a blinding flash. Grenades have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded for 1 minute. At the start of an affected creature's turn, they can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.

#### Mine, Flash
When you use your action to set it, this mine sets an imperceptible laser line extending up to 15 feet. When the laser is tripped, the mine explodes, and each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded for 1 minute. At the start of an affected creature's turn, they can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.

### Life Support

#### Emergency Raft
This raft comes packed in a 2-foot-long tube. When activated, the raft quickly deploys, expanding to full size in six seconds. The raft is 6 feet long and 3 feet wide, and can hold up to four Medium creatures not exceeding 800 lb. It comes with two collapsible oars with which to row. The raft can be collapsed and restored over the course of 1 minute.

#### Emergency Rations (One day's)
Emergency rations come in small pill form, provide all the necessary nourishment for one person for one day, and take up roughly one-tenth the space of field rations. 

#### Emergency Shelter
This shelter comes packed in a 2-foot-long tube. When activated, the shelter deploys, expanding to full size in 1 minute. The shelter is 8 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet tall, and can house up to six Medium creatures. The shelter includes spikes that automatically mount to the ground, provided they can find purchase. The shelter comes with an integrated power generator, faint glowing lights in the interior which provide dim light, and creatures in the shelter are protected from the elements, including hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The shelter's power generator lasts for seven days, after which it stops providing light. The shelter can be collapsed and restored over the course of 10 minutes.

#### Underwater Respirator
Underwater respirators are worn over the mouth and lower face. While worn, you can breath underwater, as the respirator filters the water to create breathable oxygen. The respirator functions for 1 hour per power cell (to a maximum of 2 hours) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.
 
#### Water Suit
Water suits are sealed suits that prevent water from getting in or out. Additionally, while wearing a water suit, you can breath underwater, as the suit filters the water to create breathable oxygen.

### Storage

#### Camtono
A camtono is a secured, handle container used for transporting valuable goods. The camtono features a keyed lock, which requires a DC 20 security kit to force open. It can hold up to 5 lb., not exceeding a volume of 1/4 cubic foot.

#### Hovercart
This repulsorcraft is designed to efficiently move large amounts of goods. It has a speed of 30 feet and can hold up to 2,000 lb., not exceeding a volume of 120 cubic feet.

#### Smugglepack
This backpack comes with a main compartment that can store up to 15 lb., not exceeding a volume of 1/2 cubic foot. Additionally, it has a hidden storage compartment that can hold up to 5 lb, not exceeding a volume of 1/4 cubic foot. Finding the hidden compartment requires a DC 15 Investigation check.

### Utilities

#### Basic Computer Spike
When you make an Intelligence (slicer's kit) check, you can use the spike (no action required) to reroll the check. You must use the new roll. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the spike, but you must decide before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.

#### Basic Security Spike
When you make an Intelligence (security kit) check, you can use the spike (no action required) to reroll the check. You must use the new roll. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the spike, but you must decide before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.

#### Fire Extinguisher
As an action, you can expend a use of the extinguisher to create a 15 foot cone of misty air which lasts for 6 seconds, snuffing out any unenhanced fires within range. Additionally, each creature within range must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this effect. An extinguisher can be used 5 times before it must be replenished at its original cost.

#### Gravity Generator
Gravity generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal artificial gravity source. Activating or deactivating the belt requires a bonus action and, while active, you are able to move as if in a standard gravitational pull. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.

### Weapon and Armor Accessories

#### Holster
A holster can be worn on the leg, hip, or back, and can be used to store a single weapon. You can draw a weapon stored in a holster without using an action. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you store a weapon in the holster as an action.

#### Power Belt
This belt has slots to hold six power cells, and can be connected to directly power a single blaster weapon that uses power cells. Once per turn, if the powered weapon would be reloaded, it can be done without using an action. Connecting or disconnecting a weapon takes an action. Replacing an expended power cell takes an action.

#### Propulsion Pack
Propulsion packs enhance underwater movement. Activating or deactivating the propulsion pack requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. The propulsion pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.

#### Repulsor Pack
Repulsor packs are used to slow descent from a high elevation. Activating or deactivating the repulsor pack requires a bonus action and, while active, your rate of descent slow to 60 feet per round, and you ignore the effects of wind of less than moderate speed (no more than 10 mph). The repulsor pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.

#### Shock Gloves
A shock glove is a type of armored glove that is coated with a webbed lacing. When used for an attack, this webbing carries a charge that deals 1d4 lightning damage to any objects that the glove come in contact with. If you are engaged in combat with the target of the attack, you must make a grapple check instead of an attack roll, using a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).

#### Shoulder Cannon
A shoulder cannon is a weapon mounted on a creature's shoulder with an integrated targeting interface that uses traditional power cells. When you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can fire this weapon instead. It has the ammunition (range 60/240), burst 4, and reload 4 properties, and deals 1d8 energy damage on a hit. The shoulder cannon has a proficiency bonus of +2 and a Dexterity score of 16, which are used instead of your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier when making attack and damage rolls with it.

## Tools
A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, pick a lock, or slice into a computer. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools, when lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.

## Substances
Substances, most commonly coming in the alcohol and spice varieties, are goods often sought after by the more seedy denizens of the *Star Wars* underworld. Whether legal or not, people search for these wares, whether to consume or profit on.

### Consumption
Consuming substances offers powerful temporary boons in the form of a high, potentially offset by a subsequent low. Additionally, consuming substances regularly risks addiction, which reduces the efficacy of substances until a creature abstains from using them.

#### Highs and Lows
Each substance offers a high followed immediately by a potential low. For the duration of the high, a creature might gain a bonus to an ability score, temporary force or tech points, or some other boon. Immediately when the high ends, the character must succeed on a saving throw depending on the substance or suffer a longer-lasting low, which reverses the effects. The high and low varies depending on the substance consumed, and the duration of the high and low vary based on the rarity of the substance consumed, as determined in the item's description.

A creature can only benefit from one substance at a time. If a creature consumes an additional unit of a substance, while currently experiencing a high or a low, they must immediately make a saving throw to resist the effects of addiction before applying the benefits of the consumed substance. Consuming a substance while experiencing a low immediately ends the low, but any time remaining in that low is added to the duration of the low of the additional consumed substance.

#### Addiction
Consuming substances regularly also risks becoming addicted to a substance. When the low of a substance ends, a creature must make a saving throw, determined by what substance they are coming off of, as determined in the substance's description. Addiction is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of addiction, as specified in the effect's description.

##### Addiction Level
|Level|Effect|
|:--:|:--|
|1|The duration of lows is doubled.|
|2|The duration of highs is halved.|
|3|The duration of lows is quadrupled, instead of doubled.|
|4|The effect of highs is halved.|
|5|The effect of lows is maximized.|
|6|The effect of highs is minimized.|

| &emsp;Yarrock             |   85 cr  |  1/8 lb  |

If an already addicted creature suffers another effect that causes addiction, its current level of addiction increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of addiction as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 addiction has the duration of its lows doubled, and the duration of its highs halved.

An effect that removes addiction reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all addiction effects ending if a creature's addiction level is reduced below 1.

If a creature abstains from consuming a substance for 24 hours, they can make a Wisdom saving throw to reduce their addiction level by 1, provided they've completed a long rest during that 24 hours. The DC for the saving throw equals 10 + the creature's addiction level. On a success, their addiction level is reduced by 1. For instance, a creature suffering addiction level 3 can abstain from consuming any substance for 24 hours. If they do so, and they complete a long rest during that 24 hour period, they can make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, their addiction level is reduced to 2.

> #### Availability 
> While alcoholic beverages are legal on most planets, spices are not. Whether or these items are readily available is up to your GM.

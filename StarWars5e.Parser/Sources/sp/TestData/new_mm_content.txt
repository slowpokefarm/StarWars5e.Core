## Abeloth
Abeloth, also known as the Bringer of Chaos and Beloved Queen of the Stars, is a being very powerful in both the dark the light sides of the Force. She first lived as the Servant, a mortal woman who served the powerful Ones on an unknown jungle planet over a hundred thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. Over the course of her life, she became the Mother: she kept the peace between the Father's warring Son and Daughter and became a loving part of the family. But she was still mortal—she grew old while her ageless family lived on—and she feared she would lose her precious family. In a desperate attempt to hold onto the life she so loved, she drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge. Her actions corrupted her, transforming the Mother into the twisted, immortal entity known as Abeloth.

***Loneliness.*** Abeloth is antagonized by loneliness; she feels an absolute need to be loved and adored. She has fed her cravings by instilling in Force-sensitives a desire to be with her, and in turn catered to their every need and assumed the role as their mother. This need stems from her original fear of losing her family. When her family abandoned her on their planet—the very reason she committed her crimes in the first place—she was driven insane by loneliness and despair. She feeds on fear and destruction in an attempt to gain more power; her ultimate goal is to recreate her lost family. She may try to force players to drink from the Font of Power, attempting to make replacements for the Son and Daughter.

***Appearance.*** Abeloth has the ability to change her appearance at will. However, Abeloth's true form is that of a humanoid and barely-female being with deeply-sunken black eye sockets and tiny silver eyes reminiscent of tiny stars at the bottom of a deep well. She has a long cascade of straw-like, honey-blond hair that reaches to the ground and a large, full-lipped mouth that stretches from ear-to-ear and contains needle-like teeth. Her arms are stubby, protruding no more than ten centimeters from her shoulders, with hands that had long, writhing tentacles for fingers with suction cup tips. Her body is rigid and straight, and when she walks or runs, her legs ripple forward more than they swing. In addition, her body may be enshrouded in mist, giving her an ethereal aspect to her already frightening appearance.

***Powers & Abilities.***  Abeloth's strength in the Force is a dozen times that of the most powerful Force user in the galaxy.  She wields exceptional telekinetic powers, being able to release waves of Force energy that cause beings in her vicinity to implode, those farther away to be ripped to pieces, and buildings to melt to the ground. She is also able to teleport herself from one place to another. Abeloth can produce a Force-flash, affecting the visuals of ships in an entire star system. Abeloth can command the native flora of her planet.  She has the ability to influence the minds of Force-sensitive beings who have spent an extended period of time in the Maw, causing a psychosis which makes them believe that everyone—except for other such psychotic beings—has been replaced by impostors and instilling in them a desire to find her.

&emsp;***Possession.*** Abeloth is capable of possessing or absorbing the consciousness of beings in order to further enhance her power. Abeloth is able to take on the physical appearances of beings that she has consumed, and she is also able to project images of other beings.  She prefers to inhabit the bodies of Force-sensitives, as non Force-sensitives' bodies fail to last for long before deteriorating.  However, her dependency on avatars may ultimately be her greatest weakness: killing a significant number of avatars in her possession appears to result in her strength weakening such that her manifestation may be defeated. 

***Imprisonment.*** For thousands of years, Abeloth has been imprisoned in the Maw, which is a cluster of black holes artificially created by Centerpoint Station and maintained from within by Sinkhole Station.  These stations are believed to have been created by the Celestials.  Abeloth's release from the Maw may be due to a number of reasons including the destruction or compromise of Sinkhole Station, or by a Current of the Force being altered and the flow of time changing. 

***Defeat.*** If enough of her avatars are defeated, Abeloth's primary manifestation, usually in and about her home planet in the Maw, may be defeated in combat.  Such a Force entity cannot be "truly" killed by normal means. It is thought that, if defeated, Abeloth would return: perhaps in one hundred years or perhaps in one hundred thousand years. However, it is believed by some that the Dagger of Mortis would be capable of killing Abeloth permanently. 

Additionally or alternatively, Abeloth may be contained by recreating the prison of the Maw or by some other equivalent means.

### Abeloth's Lair
Abeloth's home planet is located in the Maw.  Abeloth holds complete control over the planet's flora and fauna. The planet is notable for having numerous physical locations that corresponded to metaphysical locations in the realm known as beyond shadows. The planet was inhabited by the Ones until the Son and Daughter imprisoned Abeloth on the world.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Abeloth can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Abeloth creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in any square within 1 mile of Abeloth.  On her turn, Abeloth can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to her walking speed (no action required).  The first time a creature interacts physically with the duplicate, the duplicate disappears.
- Abeloth causes up to 2 beasts within the lair to become dominated.  They obey her telepathic commands, which reach the entire lair.
- Up to four plant creatures within the lair can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack.

#### Regional Effects
The region around Abeloth's lair is warped by her will, creating the following effect:
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the Lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness: "Everyone—except for other such psychotic beings—has been replaced by imposters.  I must find Abeloth." A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be effected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  This madness lasts until cured or until Abeloth is defeated.

If Abeloth is defeated, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

>
> ***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (3d12+9) kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.  If the target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0, they die and their essence is absorbed into Abeloth.
>
> ***Will.***  Abeloth turns her will upon one creature she can see within 120 feet.  That target must make a DC 23 Wisdome saving throw.  Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert it's attention to automatically succeed on the save.  If the target does so, it can't see Abeloth until the start of its next turn.  If the target again focuses on Abeloth in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
>
>If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Abeloth's choice or at random:
>
>**1. Beguiling Will.** The target is stunned until the start of Abeloth's next turn.
>
>**2. Hypnotic Will.** The target is charmed by Abeloth until the start of Abeloth's next turn.  Abeloth chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement.  Because this effect requires Abeloth's strong effort, she can't use her Maddening Will legendary action until the start of her next turn.
>
>**3. Insane Will.** The target suffers the effect of the *confusion* power without making a saving throw.  The effect lasts until the start of Abeloth's next turn.  Abeloth doesn't need to concentrate on the power.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> Abeloth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.  Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.  Abeloth regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.
>
> ***Draining Lightning.*** *Ranged Power Attack:* +17 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d10+9) lightning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.
>
> ***Maddening Will.*** Abeloth uses her Will action, and must choose either the Beguiling Will or the Insane Will effect.

## Acklays
The acklay is a non-sentient mix of crustacean and reptile with amphibious traits that allow it to inhabit the water and land of its homeworld of Vendaxa. The gigantic creature is protected by a hard, shell-like carapace of bony nodules. They walk on six hardened, skin-covered claws, and have grappling hands. Its mouth is filled with razor-sharp teeth, and uses an organ beneath its chin to sense the electricical field given off by its prey, which it then spears with its pointed legs. The species has stretchy stomachs and three eyes.

## Aiwha
Massive, winged cetaceans, the aiwha were native to both the oceans and skies of the planet Kamino, capable of both swimming and flying using their wingtips to propel them through either substance. Their long, beak-like mouths featured a baleen used for filtering krill from seawater. The non-sentient species, one of a wide variety of aquatic life on Kamino, was also known as the "air whale", and were a peaceful and majestic species. Aiwha gave out bleating cries when dying.

***History.*** When the climate of Kamino changed drastically, leading to planet-wide flooding when the ice caps melted, the native Kaminoans adapted both themselves and some of their fellow creatures to their new environment. The aiwhas were among those who were adapted using the Kaminoans' advanced cloning technologies, and became biological curiosities used as mounts to traverse Kamino's endless ocean. The Kaminoans used aiwhas as mounts, although aiwha-riders traveled beneath the waters during the lashing tempests of the severe electrical storms which raged for much of the planet's year.

## Anooba
Anoobas were aggressive pack predators native to Tatooine. Opportunistic hunters as well as scavengers, these wolflike canines would attack virtually anything smaller than themselves (such as scurriers) and would band together in packs to bring down rontos, eopies, and similar creatures.

Strong, horny beaks on their jaws assisted in the breaking of thick skeletons, while long, tufted tails helped to counterbalance the body and dissipate heat. Anoobas could vary in weight from 20 to 45 kilograms—males being larger than females—and often banded into packs of ten to twelve. These units were dominated by an alpha male and alpha female, and it was not uncommon to see entire packs waiting alongside podrace courses for an easy meal.

Like the winged urusai, accounts tell of anoobas being so engorged on meals that they are unable to move. This may be due in part to the fact that anooba mothers fed their young, born three to four at a time, through regurgitation.

***Domestication.*** Anoobas were also known to be, like the massiff, domesticated by Tatooine's Tusken Raiders as pets and guard animals.

***Off-World.*** Packs of escaped, adaptable anoobas imported from Tatooine roamed Coruscant alleys looking for prey. As a result, nocturnal foot traffic<br> in certain areas was highly risky. Anoobas on Coruscant were known to howl at the planet's<br> moons. Anoobas were sometimes caught in<br> packs and used as gladiatorial fighting<br> animals, for which they were given a<br> shock collar to control their behavior.

## Assassin Droids

</div>

<div class='wide'>

Assassin droids are a type of droid built specifically for the purpose of assassination. These droids generally perform with unflinching loyalty to their masters, but rogue assassin droids are not unknown. Since their missions generally require a far higher degree of independent skill, savvy, and judgment than normally possessed by simple war droids, their programming subroutines, circuitry, and memory cores are of correspondingly higher sophistication.

Equipped with an array of weapons, assassin droids are also used as elite infantry when the need for skillful and quickly adaptable soldiers with unquestionable loyalty arises.

An inordinate number of assassin droids have achieved sentient independence, including IG-88 and C-3PX, presumably due to the higher level of autonomy incorporated into their processor design. These droids typically fund their independent existences through the use of their innate abilities, often plying their trade as bounty hunters.

</div>

### Blastromech Series
A homicidal assassin droid created by the Galactic Empire's Tarkin Initiative, the<br> BT-1 model is designed to<br> look like an astromech<br> droid in order to fool<br> others. The droid is armed<br> with a variety of weapons<br> including several blaster<br> cannons, flamethrowers,<br> and rockets.  The BT-1<br> model is also equipped<br> with rocket boosters.

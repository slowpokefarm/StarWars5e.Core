<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:76px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s soon as heroes get theirs hands on a starship,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they want to modify it. The desire for faster hyperdrives, more weapons, better shields, and possibly even some space for smuggled goods generally comes before the first payment to a Hutt loan shark is due. Upgrading and modifying a starship gives players a sense of ownership that makes them more connected to a campaign, and it serves other useful purposes as well.

Heroes who want to improve a starship have a built-in reason to take risks to earn credits (or other re-<br>wards, such as the use of the repair bay of a grateful military group). Although *Star Wars* focuses on on heroic action-adventure over the cobbling together of credits for tinkering with a ship, many characters are simply more motivated if they know there's a material reward on the line. Furthermore, a starship acts as a good base of operations, allowing heroes to have a place that seems like home even as they gallivant across the galaxy. Finally, as the heroes gain levels, a better-equipped ship prepares them for greater challenges.

## Modifying a Starship
When ships are produced, they are left with a certain amount of extra space, superstructure and power consumption leftover to facilitate the addition of new system modifications and suites. In addition to the costs associated with acquiring raw materials, components and installation, each one of these modifications consumes one of a ship's modification slots. This section details all of the system modifications available to a ship. There are five categories of modifications, discussed later in this chapter.

When players acquire a new ship, it typically comes with minimal modifications already installed. Players then choose the modifications they want installed on their ship. Like construction and upgrading, installing new systems and modifying old ones takes materials, time, and a substantial workforce. Even with the requisite components, the GM may decide that a modification is inaccessible; it might only be obtainable if the heroes get hold of it directly, by recovering it from a supply depot, trading it off of a collector, or stealing it from the manufacturer. 

The cost of a modification depends on the category from which it comes, as shown below in the Modification Category Cost table.

\columnbreak

##### Modification Category Base Cost
| Modification Category | Base Cost |
|:----|----:|
| Engineering  | 3,500 cr |
| Operation | 3,500 cr |
| Suite | 5,000 cr |
| Universal | 4,000 cr |
| Weapon | 3,000 cr |

### Size Modifiers
In the same way it costs more to upgrade a capital ship than a starfighter, it costs more to modify it as well. Each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Modification Cost table below:

##### Starship Size Modification Cost
| Starship<br> Size | Cost<br> Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| Tiny  |x 0.5 |
| Small |x 1 |
| Medium|x 2 |
| Large |x 5 |
| Huge |x 50 |
| Gargantuan |x 500 |

For instance, to purchase and install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, it costs 3,000 credits. To purchase and install one on a Huge ship, however, it costs 150,000 (3,000 x 50).

Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform modifications. For a Small ship, two people can do everything necessary (though additional staff will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Modification Workforce table.

##### Starship Size Modification Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 2 |
| Medium  | 4 |
| Large  | 10 |
| Huge | 100 |
| Gargantuan | 1,000 |

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Modification Slots
The number of modifications that a ship can easily accommodate is based on the ship's size, as shown below in the Modification Capacity by Ship Size table.

#### Modification Capacity by Ship Size

| Starship Size | Modification Capacity |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  |10 |
| Small |20 |
| Medium |30 |
| Large |50 |
| Huge |60 |
| Gargantuan |70 |

However, if you lack sufficient modification slots to support a modification, you can still add it, if you are willing to spend more time and credits for installing all the space and subsystems required to support the modification.  For every modification slot you manually add to your ship, add 50% to the modification category base cost.  Additionally, for every modification you install over your modification capacity, add a cumulative 2 to the installation DC for a tiny to medium ship, and a cumulative 1 to the installation DC for a large to gargantuan ship.

### Modification Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be modified in no more than a week's time. However, a new modification layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to modify a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("modification category base cost" x "starship size modification cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, with a workforce of 2, it takes three days. To install one on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, it also takes 3 days.

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

### Modification Grade And Ship Tier
Finally, modifications have a grade (0 if not listed). High-grade modifications are more costly, using scarce materials to construct and install. When purchasing and installing a modification with a listed grade, multiply the final cost of the modification by the modification�s grade and add that amount to the final cost.  As an example, a Grade 2 modification would have two times the final cost added to that final cost, resulting in a total installation cost of three times that of a modification without a listed Grade. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div> 

Additionally, these modifications require more precise skill to install, as shown below in the Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier table. However, ships of higher quality (high tier) make it easier to install these high-quality (high grade) modifications.  

### Modification Installation Check
When making a modification, the foremost mechanic must make an Intelligence (Mechanic�s Kit) check to correctly install modifications. The DC for the check varies based on the grade of the modification and the tier of the ship, as shown below in the Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier table below.

##### Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier  
|Modification<br> Grade|Tier<br> 0|Tier<br> 1|Tier<br> 2|Tier<br> 3|Tier<br> 4|Tier<br> 5|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Grade 0**| 10|  9|  8|  7|  6|  5|
|**Grade 1**| 17| 12| 11| 10|  9|  8| 
|**Grade 2**| 24| 19| 14| 13| 12| 11| 
|**Grade 3**| 31| 26| 21| 16| 15| 14| 
|**Grade 4**| 38| 33| 28| 23| 18| 17| 
|**Grade 5**| 45| 40| 35| 30| 25| 20| 

On a failure, half the requisite time and cost is incurred, but the modification is not installed.

### Prerequisites
Some modifications have prerequisites that must be met before they can be installed. 

If at any time you lose access to a modification's prerequisite, such as removal or ship damage, you can't use that modification again until you regain access to the prerequisite.

### Ability Score Maximums
If a tier feature or modification would increase an ability score above its maximum without also increasing that maximum, you can instead allocate that additional ability score increase to another ability score.

### Changing Saving Throw Proficiency
When a starship is created, a saving throw proficiency may be chosen from a list available to the starship. Later on, however, players may want to change their starship's saving throw proficiency to another of the available options. Changing a saving throw proficiency requires time and credits as if installing a new universal modification.

### Removing Modifications
Sometimes, characters might decide they want to remove a modification in favor of a new one. Removing a modification requires half the cost it takes to install the modification originally, and takes half the time.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Removing Tiers
Sometimes, characters might decide they want to change a selection made for a starship tier feature. To do so, they must remove the tier from the ship, reducing the ship's tier by one. Doing so removes all features from the ship earned at the new tier, including Ability Score Improvements, additional Hull and Shield Dice, and additional modifications.

Removing a starship tier requires half the cost it takes to upgrade to that tier, and takes half the time.

If upgrading the ship to the tier again at the same time as removal, the additional time to remove is incurred, but the cost to remove is not required.

### Starship Tier Features
If a modification is granted to your starship by a starship tier feature, such as the Role Specialization feature, that modification does not require an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check, comes at no additional cost, and you can't voluntarily remove it. It does, however, take up a modification slot.  If your starship already has that modification, you may install an additional modification that is available to you and of equal or lesser grade instead.

### Stock Modifications
Also at tier 0, each ship comes with a number of modifications, at no additional cost, depending on its size, as shown in chapter 3. These modifications do take up modification slots.

## Modification Categories
There are five categories of modification. Each category has separate rules governing its use.

### Engineering Systems
These modifications offer unique functionality to the ship. Each engineering system can be chosen multiple times.

### Operation Systems
These specialized modifications aid in the operation and response of the ship. Each operation system can be chosen only once.

\columnbreak

### Suite Systems
Suite systems add additional functionality to the ship in the form of bays, stations and designated areas, offering increased utility to civilians, crew members, and troopers. Each suite system can be chosen no more than ten times. All suite systems require a ship of size Small or larger. In addition to their modification slot cost, ships are limited to the number of suite systems they can have, depending on the ship's size and constitution modifier, as shown below in the Starship Size Maximum Suites table.

##### Starship Size Maximum Suites
| Starship Size | Suite Capacity |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | � |
| Small  | -1 + con. mod. |
| Medium  | 3 + con. mod. |
| Large  | 3 + 2x con. mod. |
| Huge | 6 + 3x con. mod. |
| Gargantuan | 10 + 4x con. mod. |

Additionally, unless otherwise specified, each suite system can accommodate a standard number of civilians, crew members, or troopers, as shown below in the Starship Size Suite Capacity table.  A ship does not gain a feature that accommodates less than 1.

##### Starship Size Suite Capacity
| Starship Size | Suite Capacity |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | � |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium  | 4 |
| Large  | 400 |
| Huge | 4,000 |
| Gargantuan | 40,000 |

### Universal Systems
These modifications offer passive benefits to the ship as a whole. Each Universal System can be chosen only once.

### Weapon Systems
These modifications deal with the installation and improvement of weapon systems. Each weapon system can be chosen multiple times.

A ship is proficiently equipped by having the weapon system installed, therefore any crew member using a system can add their proficiency bonus when the weapon system indicates.

<div style='margin-top:201px'></div>

## Engineering Systems
The systems are presented in alphabetical order. If a system has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the system at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

### Advanced SLAM
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** SLAM_<br>
Your ship's SubLight Acceleration Motor (SLAM) has been enhanced, granting more utility.  When a pilot takes the Dash action, the increase now equals twice your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 300 feet, for example, your ship can move up to 900 feet on its turn if you dash. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your ship's speed of 300 feet is reduced to 150 feet, for instance, your ship can move up to 450 feet this turn if you dash.

This action still affects your entire ship: any skill check or attack roll made by your ship or anyone on it has disadvantage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Alternative Fuel Converter
Your ship is equipped with an alternative fuel converter which allows the conversion of materials to a potential fuel source. Over the course of 10 minutes, a crew member can make a constitution (Regulation) check (DC  = 10 or half the number of days since the ship's last refueling, whichever number is higher). On a success, the ship recovers one day's worth of fuel.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

### Automated Protocols
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Damage Control System_<br>
You upgrade your damage control system. A crew member can take the Patch action as a reaction.  This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting. Additionally, you can add your ship's intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to whenever you roll hull dice to regain hull points.  

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:226px'></div>

&emsp;Finally, your ship is expertly equipped for Constitution (Patch) checks.

### Boarding Harpoon
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Hardened Prow_<br>
Your ship has been further modified with a massive grappling harpoon, through which creatures can pass. Your ship is expertly equipped for Strength (Ram) checks.

Additionally, when a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, on a hit, they become harpooned. While harpooned, the target ship's flying speed is reduced to 0, and your ship's flying speed is reduced by half. Your ship's pilot can release the harpooned ship at any time (no action required). The harpooned ship is automatically released if your ship becomes disabled, or if it is forcefully moved more than 100 feet away from your ship.

***Removing the Harpoon.*** A harpooned ship's pilot can use its action to make a contested Strength (Boost) check, ending the effect on a success.

***Moving a Harpooned Ship.*** When your ship moves, it can drag the harpooned ship with it, unless the ship is larger than your ship.

***Boarding a Harpooned Ship.*** While the ship is harpooned, up to six creatures of Medium size or smaller can move through the gap onto the harpooned ship each round.

***Recovering the Harpoon.*** Recovering and reinstalling the harpoon takes 1 minute.

### Buzz Droid Cloud
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
As an action, a crew member may scatter a large number of Buzz Droids across space in a 200-foot radius sphere centered on a point within 1500 feet. These Buzz Droids tear apart the hull of any ship that encounters them. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a ship moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 kinetic damage directly to the hull for every 50 feet it travels.

The Buzz Droids are nearly invisible in the darkness of space. Any creature or ship that can�t see the area at the time the area is created must make a Wisdom (Scan) check (DC 15) to notice the Buzz Droids before entering the area.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.



<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk I
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>
As an action, a crew member may cause a wave of cold energy to spread out from your ship. Each ship in a 150-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 2d6 cold damage and gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage, and suffers no additional effect.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk II
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk II_<br>
As an action, a crew member may cause an explosion of cold energy to erupt from a point it chooses within 900 feet. Each ship in a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a ship takes half as much damage and isn�t slowed.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk III
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk II_<br>
A storm of cryogenic energy encompasses space in a 300-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet. Each ship in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). A creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The storm�s area of effect becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk IV
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk III_<br>
As an action, your ship can create a cloud of icy fog in a 200-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet. The sphere extends around objects, and its area is heavily obscured. The fog is semi-solid, and its area is considered difficult terrain. Each ship that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 4d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its turn. The fog lasts for one minute or until it�s dispersed.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

\columnbreak

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk V
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk IV_<br>
As an action, a crew member may generate an explosion of cryogenic energy in a 600-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 2500 feet. Each ship in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's iwisdom modifier). On a failed save, the ship takes 8d6 + 20 cold damage and is stunned for 1 minute as it is encased in carbonite. On a successful save, the ship takes half damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn.

As an action, a crew member of a stunned ship can make a Strength check (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier), ending this effect on itself on a success.

A ship reduced to 0 hit points by this power explodes instantly, as its hull shatters into frozen chunks.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Countermeasures
This modification adds a series of countermeasures to the ship, granting it a more active approach to ward off effects. Once per round, when your ship is forced to make a saving throw against an effect that would cause it to be blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, or stunned, a crew member can use their reaction to add the ship's Wisdom modifier to the roll (minimum of +1).

### Damage Control System
You install a damage control system on your ship.  A crew member can take the Patch action as a bonus action.  This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Constitution (Patch) checks.

### Electrical Dischargers
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>
As an action a crew member may cause your ship to emit a burst of electricity. Each ship within 50 feet, other than you, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's strength modifier) or take 1d6 lightning damage.

This power�s damage increases by 1d6 for every tier your ship is above first tier: 2nd tier (2d6), 3rd tier (3d6), 4th tier (4d6), and 5th tier (5d6).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk I
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>
As an action, a crew member can cause a ship you can see within 300 feet to become shrouded with electronic interference and holographic illusions. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier), or it takes 1d6 lightning damage and moves 50 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 50 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn�t move.

This power�s damage increases by 1d6 for every tier your ship is above first tier: 2nd tier (2d6), 3rd tier (3d6), 4th tier (4d6), and 5th tier (5d6).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk II
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk I_<br>
As an action, a crew member may choose up to three ships that you can see within 300 feet to make Wisdom saving throws (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). The first time each turn a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw for up to a minute until the ability ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

A crew member must use it's bonus action to maintain this ability.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk III
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk II_<br>
You choose one ship you can see within 1200 feet and scramble its ability to differentiate targets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot�s Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all ships it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected ship chooses another target, it must choose the target at random from among the ships it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it�s using. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

\columnbreak

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk IV
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk III_<br>
As an action, a crew member may scramble the targeting protocols of nearby ships. Each ship in a 300-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier).  If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot�s Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies up to a minute, until the ability ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

A crew member must use it's bonus action to maintain this ability.

Whenever the affected ship chooses another target, it must choose the target at random from among the ships it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk V
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk IV_<br>
You emit an electromagnetic pulse, potentially shutting down all ships besides your own within 1200 feet. Ships within range must succeed on a Wisdom (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or become disabled up to a minute or until the power ends. 

A crew member must use it's bonus action to maintain this ability.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Emergency Generator
Your ship is equipped with an emergency generator to recharge shields. When your ship is reduced to 0 shield points but not destroyed outright, a crew member can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 shield point instead. Alternatively, if the ship has 0 shield points, a crew member can use their action to restore shield points equal to twice the ship's strength modifier. 

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship recharges.


<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum


### Feedback Shield
Your ship's shield is enhanced to reflect damage to would-be attackers. As a reaction to the ship being hit with a primary or secondary weapon, a crew member can use their reaction to deal damage to the attacking ship. The damage depends on your ship's size: 1d4 for a Tiny ship, 1d6 for a Small ship, 1d8 for a Medium ship, 1d10 for a Large ship, 1d12 for a Huge ship, or 1d20 for a Gargantuan ship. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Flare Pods
Your ship is a equipped with a series of counter-measure flares. When your ship is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, a crew member can use their reaction to release a flare. When they do so, your ship has advantage on the triggering saving throw. The crew member can choose to use this feature after the roll is made, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If they already have advantage on the saving throw, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

### Hardened Prow
Your ship has been modified to to be more effective at ramming. When a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, and the target fails the saving throw, the damage dealt is increased by an amount equal to two of your ship's Hull Dice. 

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Strength (Ram) checks.  


### Improved Countermeasures
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Countermeasures_<br>
This modification enhances your ship's countermeasures, allowing it to quickly clear lingering effects. As an action, a crew member can activate this feature, ending the blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, and stunned conditions.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

Additionally, your ship is expertly equipped for Wisdom saving throws.  If it was already expertly equipped, the ship can now add half its Constitution modifier (rounded down) to its Wisdom saving throws.


\columnbreak

### Interdiction Drive
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>
You install an interdiction drive on your ship, which can be activated to impede ships around it. As an action, a crew member can engage the interdiction drive. Each ship within 100 feet of your ship must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew members's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship's flying speed is reduced by 100 feet and its turning speed is increased by 50 feet until the end of your ship's next turn.

If a ship is two or more sizes larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it is two or more sizes smaller, it instead has disadvantage. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Invulnerability Drive
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
Your ship is equipped with an experimental device which can render it immune to all damage. As an action, a crew member can activate the drive. Once activated, the drive lasts for 1d4 rounds, granting the following benefits:
- Your ship is immune to all damage.
- Your ship's flying speed is reduced by half.
- Your ship's turning speed is doubled.

A crew member can end this effect at any time, no action required. When the effect ends, the crew member must make a Destruction saving throw. On a failure, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes refitting.

### MINING LASER
Your ship is equipped with a laser used to extract ores and other minerals from objects such as asteroids.  Checks made while using the mining laser for determining outcomes of work (for example, using downtime rules from Wretched Hives) are made with advantage. If you already have advantage on the roll, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

Additionally, a crew member can activate the mining laser as an action in order to make a Strength (Boost) check against a ship that is touching you (for example, a ship that is ramming or being rammed by your ship, or one you are landed on) (DC = the ship's AC).  On a success, the adjacent ship takes 1d8 + Strength modifier energy damage.

### Nano-Droid Distributor
Your ship is equipped with a nano-droid distributor that allows it to repair other ships. When a crew member takes the Patch action, they can instead repair another ship within 100 feet. You spend and roll one of your ship's Hull Dice, and the target ship regains that many hull points.

### Power Backup
Your ship is equipped with a back up battery, which can give it renewed energy. When your ship is reduced to 0 hull points but not destroyed outright, a crew member can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 hull point instead. Alternatively, if the ship is making Destruction saving throws, a crew member can use their action to have the ship automatically succeed on a Destruction saving throw.

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Power Harpoon
As an action, a crew member may make a ship weapon attack with the power harpoon.  The harpoon's range is 400/1600 ft.  On a hit, the target is harpooned, connecting your ship to the target by a 1,600 foot cable. 

At any time as a free action, if the connected objects are closer than 1600 feet, a crew member on your ship can choose whether the cable is slack or taught. When the cable is taught, any movement by one object away from the other, tows the other object.  When the cable is taught, movement by the first object away from the other object is considered movement through difficult terrain if the first object is within one size category of the other object.  An object two or more size categories smaller than the other object cannot move away from the other object when the cable is taught.

If the objects are 1600 feet apart, the cable is always taught.

While connected by the cable, a crew member can use a bonus action to reel, pulling your ship towards the target (if larger than your ship), or the target to-wards your ship (if the same size or smaller than your ship) by 200 feet. At any time, a crew member on your ship can release the cable (no action required).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

As an action, a crew member of a harpooned ship can attempt to remove the harpoon. To do so, the ship must succeed on a Strength (boost) check contested by your Strength (boost) or Dexterity (maneuver) check.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Self-Destruct Mechanism
Your ship is equipped with a self-destruct mechanism that can cause immense destruction at the expense of the ship. A crew member can activate the self-destruct mechanism as an action, setting a timer up to 10 minutes in length. When the timer expires, the ship explodes, dealing thermite damage to each enemy within range. The damage is calculated as follows; for each Hull Die the ship has, roll it and add the ship's Strength modifier to the roll. 


The range that the self-destruct mechanism impacts varies, depending on the ship's size:
- **Tiny**: A Tiny ship deals damage to each ship within 50 feet of it.
- **Small**: A Small ship deals damage to each ship within 100 feet of it.
- **Medium**: A Medium ship deals damage to each ship within 200 feet of it.
- **Large**: A Large ship deals damage to each ship within 400 feet of it.
- **Huge**: A Huge ship deals damage to each ship within 1,000 feet of it.
- **Gargantuan**: A Gargantuan ship deals damage to each ship within 2,000 feet of it.


### Shield Bleedthrough
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
Your ship's reactor is overhauled to give temporary boosts to your ship's weapon batteries. When your ship hits another ship with a primary or secondary weapon attack while it still has shield points, a crew member can use their reaction to cause some of the damage to bleed through. The damage the ship's shields take is reduced by an amount equal to your ship's Strength modifier. The ship's hull then takes this much damage. This damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage.

### Ship Slicer, Mk I
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>
Choose a Small or smaller ship you can see. The target must make an Intelligence (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) saving throw. On a failed save, it is disabled until the start of your next turn. Each time the ship takes damage or is the target of a hostile power or ability while disabled in this way, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

### Ship Slicer, Mk II
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk I_<br>
As an action, a crew member may upload a computer virus that stalls a ship. Roll 7d6; if the ship�s remaining hull points are less than the total, the ship is stalled for one minute or until the ship takes damage,.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Ship Slicer, Mk III
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk II_<br>
As an action, a crew member can dictate a one-word command to a ship you can see within 600 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or follow the command on its next turn. If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot�s Intelligence modifier. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can�t follow your command, the ability ends.

Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

Deactivate. The target becomes disabled and then ends its turn.

Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

Halt. The target doesn�t move and takes no actions. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Ship Slicer, Mk IV
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk III_<br>
As an action, a crew member may cause a ship that you can see within 600 feet to succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or be incapacitated for up to a minute, until the ability ends. At the end of each of its turns, the ship can make another Intelligence<br> saving throw. On a success, the power ends<br> on the target.

A crew member must use it's bonus action<br> to maintain this ability.

This feature can be used a number of times<br> equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once).<br> All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

\columnbreak


### Ship Slicer, Mk V
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk IV_<br>
As an action, a crew member can choose one ship you can see within 600 feet and attempt to remotely override its controls. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot�s Intelligence modifier. If you or ships that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the ship is charmed by you for the duration.

While the ship is charmed, you have a wireless link with it as long as the two of you are within the same system. Via your ship, you can use this link to issue commands to the ship while you are conscious (using a bonus action), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as �Attack that ship,� �Move over there,� or �Fly casual.� If the ship completes the order and doesn�t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the ship takes only the actions you choose, and doesn�t do anything that you don�t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the ship to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.  For every action, bonus action, or reaction you make the ship use, you must spend an equivalent action.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Shock Absorbers
_**Prerequisite:** Ship size Medium or larger_<br>

Finally, when your ship makes a Strength (Ram) check, it can reroll one of the dice.

### SLAM
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
Your ship gains a SubLight Acceleration Motor (SLAM).  As an action, a pilot can activate the SLAM to gain extra Movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 300 feet, for example, your ship can move up to 600 feet on its turn if you SLAM. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your ship's speed of 300 feet is reduced to 150 feet, for instance, your ship can move up to 300 feet this turn if you SLAM.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

\columnbreak

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described to below.

#### Torpedo Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the torpedo launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of torpedoes. Torpedo launchers have advantage on attack rolls against Gargantuan creatures and disadvantage on attack rolls again Large and smaller creatures. Unlike other weapons, the torpedo launcher can only be loaded using an action, and you don't add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls you make with it.

Before firing the torpedo launcher, you must first use your action to deploy it. While deployed, your speed is reduced by half. You can collapse the torpedo launcher as a bonus action.

## Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

### Ammunition

#### Fragmentation Torpedo
This torpedo launcher ammunition deals 20d4 kinetic damage on a hit. 

#### Plasma Torpedo
This torpedo launcher ammunition deals 20d4 energy damage on a hit. 

### Explosives

#### Charge, Fragmentation
A device used to blow holes in larger constructs and structures, a breaching charge creates a devastating explosion focused in a specific direction. Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.

When detonated, the breaching charge explodes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d4 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If affixed to a creature, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. Objects, structures, and other surfaces have disadvantage on the saving throw. If affixed to the object, structure, or surface, it instead automatically fails this saving throw.

### Life Support

#### Emergency Raft
This raft comes packed in a 2-foot-long tube. When activated, the raft quickly deploys, expanding to full size in six seconds. The raft is 6 feet long and 3 feet wide, and can hold up to four Medium creatures not exceeding 800 lb. It comes with two collapsible oars with which to row. The raft can be collapsed and restored over the course of 1 minute.

#### Emergency Rations (One day's)
Emergency rations come in small pill form, provide all the necessary nourishment for one person for one day, and take up roughly one-tenth the space of field rations. 

#### Emergency Shelter
This shelter comes packed in a 2-foot-long tube. When activated, the shelter deploys, expanding to full size in 1 minute. The shelter is 8 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet tall, and can house up to six Medium creatures. The shelter includes spikes that automatically mount to the ground, provided they can find purchase. The shelter comes with an integrated power generator, faint glowing lights in the interior which provide dim light, and creatures in the shelter are protected from the elements, including hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The shelter's power generator lasts for seven days, after which it stops providing light. The shelter can be collapsed and restored over the course of 10 minutes.

### Storage

#### Bottle
A bottle stores 1 and 1/2 pints of liquid.

#### Bucket
A bucket stores 3 gallons of liquid or 1/2 cubic foot of solids.

#### Flask
A flask stores 1 pint of liquid.

#### Hovercart
This repulsorcraft is designed to efficiently move large amounts of goods. It has a speed of 30 feet and can store 2,000 lb., not exceeding 120 cubic feet.

#### Jug
A jug stores 1 pint of liquid.

#### Pitcher
A pitcher stores 1 pint of liquid.

#### Pot
A pot stores 1 pint of liquid.

#### Sack
A sack stores 30 ounces, not exceeding 1 cubic foot. 

#### Tankard
A tankard stores 1 pint of liquid.

#### Vial
A vial stores 4 ounces of liquid.

### Utilities

#### Fire Extinguisher
As an action, you can expend a use of the extinguisher to create a 15 foot cone of misty air which lasts for 6 seconds, snuffing out any unenhanced fires within range. Additionally, each creature within range must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this effect. An extinguisher can be used 5 times before it must be replenished at its original cost.

#### Gravity Generator
Gravity generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal artificial gravity source. Activating or deactivating the belt requires a bonus action and, while active, you are able to move as if in a standard gravitational pull. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.

### Weapon and Armor Accessories

#### Propulsion Pack
Propulsion packs enhance underwater movement. Activating or deactivating the propulsion pack requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. The propulsion pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.

#### Repulsor Pack
Repulsor packs are used to slow descent from a high elevation. Activating or deactivating the repulsor pack requires a bonus action and, while active, your rate of descent slow to 60 feet per round, and you ignore the effects of wind of less than moderate speed (no more than 10 mph). The repulsor pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.

#### Shock Gloves
A shock glove is a type of armored glove that is coated with a webbed lacing. When used for an attack, this webbing carries a charge that deals 1d4 lightning damage to any objects that the glove come in contact with. If you are engaged in combat with the target of the attack, you must make a grapple check instead of an attack roll, using a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).

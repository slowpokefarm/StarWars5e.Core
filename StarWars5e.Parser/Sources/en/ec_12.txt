#### Cryogenic Blow
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack during this power's duration, the attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it gains a level of slowed for the duration. At the start of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Overcharge Tech.*** If you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Itemize
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You instantly learn the exact quantity of one type of item within 30 feet of you. It must be a type of item that you've handled in the past; you can't, for example, use *itemize* to find out how many *BKGs* are nearby if you've never handled such a weapon. The object being itemized must also be reasonably specific. You can learn how many meilooruns are nearby, for example, but not how much fruit.

#### Fabricate
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
You convert raw materials into products of the same material.
For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from bantha hide.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the power is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or enhanced items can't be created by this power. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of tool used to craft such objects.

#### Spectrum Discharge
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a willing creature, granting it an elemental charge. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or sonic. For the duration, a creature can use an action to expel energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Stinger
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

You fire a stinging dart at a creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 poison damage, and if the target is a humanoid or beast, it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Squad Shield
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to an incoming threat
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

In the face of danger, you create a barrier that protects you and those around you. A faintly glowing sphere of protection with a radius of 10 feet appears. The sphere lasts for the duration.

Any tech power (or force power that deals energy or lightning damage) of 7th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

Furthermore, hazards of the following types cannot physically pass through the barrier or affect anything within it.

- Physical or energy projectiles.
- A specific effect, such as a thermal detonator's explosion.
- An environmental danger, such as falling rocks or a lava flow.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the maximum radius increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 7th. In addition, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 7th.

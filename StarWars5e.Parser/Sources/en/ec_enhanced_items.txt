#### Charge, Fragmentation (Average)
_**Consumable** (explosive), <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
A device used to blow holes in larger constructs and structures, a breaching charge creates a devastating explosion focused in a specific direction. Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.

When detonated, the breaching charge explodes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d6 kinetic on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If affixed to a creature, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. Objects, structures, and other surfaces have disadvantage on the saving throw. If affixed to the object, structure, or surface, it instead automatically fails this saving throw.

#### Restraining Bolt (Fine)
_**Adventuring gear**, <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
Restraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a droid in order to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit.

Installing a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The droid must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. A hostile droid makes this save with advantage. On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save, the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively control the droid. While the control unit is inactive, the droid can act freely but it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt.

#### Mine, Corrosive (Average)
_**Consumable** (explosive), <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
Mines can be set to detonate when a creature comes within up to 15 feet of it or paired with a remote detonator. As an action, you can prime and set a mine on a surface you can reach, which arms at the start of your next turn. When detonated, each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.
